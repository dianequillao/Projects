       " 'My family and I had an amazing time. It is rather expensive but it is a must. You forget the $ stacking up when you see your kids smiling. Get fast passes but be mindful you can only ride it once on them per ride. Spend a little more and get the hopper pass, too much to see in one day.',\n",
       " 'We had a great time here. The weather was cool and lines weren’t too long. It’s a great time to come and visit.',\n",
       " 'Castmembers are friendly and helpful, most of the rides are interesting and fun but food and merchandise is very expensive. I advise going at park opening or earlier as security and main gates while take at least 20 mins. By mid afternoon it’s literally a sea of people, shoulder to shoulder so it can be tough to get around and most rides have 30 min + lineups. I don’t think 1 day would be sufficient, plan for at least 2.',\n",
       " 'Everything is top notch, fun as always. Tip for families with older children (10+) use the “singles” lines for rides. Later in the day Fast Passes close but single lines move quickly and most of the time we were still paired together on the rides (usually not sitting right next to each other though)',\n",

       " \"I had never been to a Disney park, so this was a big deal for me! It was great! I felt like a kid, and I couldn't hide my smile (the entire time)! The staff were outstanding and the park deals they had for Canadians were too good to pass up! I literally have no complaints. Favourite rides included Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise (at night), and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The fast pass system was amazing and it allowed us to get on every ride at least twice. February was the perfect time to go! I'll be back!\",\n",
       " 'I grew up going to Disneyland - was there on opening day of Space Mountain in the 1970s. It used to be so fun at Disneyland - not too crowded, clean park, everything running & polite staff. As an adult and parent - I have taken my daughter to Disneyland 3 times now - each time it got progressively less magical with the cost, the dirtiness factor, the LONG & RIDICULOUS lines and main attractions closed. This is really not the \"happiest place on earth\". My daughter rather go to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk!',\n",
       " 'Awesome, fun, exciting, adventurous, fantastic, spectacular, marvellous, happy and a supercalifragilisticexpialidiceous time was had by all.',\n",
       " 'I have been going to Disneyland with my daughter every year since she turned 4. We just completed our 4th visit, and had an amazing time. The rides are great, lots of food options, and I highly recommend going to the \"Royal Theater.\" Its a great way to pass the time while you\\'re waiting for your next fastpass, and if its hot you can get of the sun and rest your legs.',\n",
       " 'It was x21 years since my last visit. January 2018 was listed as a quiet time in the parks - even with our early magic hours to gain access from 9am - the queues were so big outside - we didn’t enter the park until 09:50am which was a shame. Main Street was actually boarded up straight from the entrance to the castle. This was also unexpected and didn’t allow us to get the photo pass pics we wanted. We have been to Paris and Florida in the last x2 yrs so wanted to get the same pics on main st. Next time. I recommend queuing at city hall (guest services) to get free badges - ‘MY FIRST VISIT’ etc. The park was spotless. Specialty treats & Disneyland only merchandise. Classic rides - Peter Pan, Pinocchio, dumbo (closed), big thunder mountain, space mountain, it’s a small world, mr toad, haunted mansion etc. Great fun. Specialty dining was worth the extra $. Photo pass was a much better offering than at DLP. A marching Disney band relaxed the Main Street parade. No fireworks. A good visit - but a bit of Disney sparkle lacking. Florida customer service still has the excellent record compared to other parks. Take plenty of £€$ - you will need it',\n",
       " 'My husband and I planned our first trip to Disneyland finally after living in Florida for over 20 years. Of course the parks and property are smaller than Disney World but we had an amazing trip. Would definitely recommend staying on property if possible because of the convenience. Unfortunately the week of our trip all of Main Street and the storybook canal boat ride were under construction. I understand sometimes attractions are closed for refurbishment but the whole length of Main Street at one time seemed a little excessive and took away from the magic slightly especially being our first trip.',\n",
       " \"If you have kids then this is a must see, must do adventure. While it is fairly expensive (look around for specials and discounts), it's something you need to experience at least once in your life. Make sure you plan on at least 2 or 3 days to visit because you can't see it all in a day. If you want to whole experience, stay at o e of the Disney hotels but once again, it will cost you. There are plenty of hotel options close to the park if you are on a budget and most offer transportation to and from the park.\",\n",
       " 'Nice day at the park. Crowds were as expected, but longest wait without fast pass was 45 min. We ate at the Golden Horse Show Saloon and stayed for the show. Fun show, they grabbed some people from the tables to join the show, so be warned if you side down front. The foot traffic in New Orleans Square got pretty crazy when people started gathering for the Fantasmic show. Be ready to come about one hour early if you want a good spot for the show.',\n",
       " 'If you want to ride your favorite ride make sure you download the Disneyland app. Not only does it give you average wait times you can download the fast pass to get on rides quicker. They only release a limited number of fast passes in a time period and you can only have one FP at a time so get in quick. I was very disappointed that we weren’t aware before we went that the whole Main Street was boarded up therefore no parades or fireworks at night. :( Apart from this we had an amazing couple of days and came home with some wonderful memories. Not for the faint hearted though. Have to be prepared to battle crowds and do a lot of waiting in queues. But apart from that this big kid (48 years young!) had a magical time! :)',\n",
       " 'This is an amazing place, lots and lots to do. Some lovely eating places. I really enjoyed my time there. I am not young, but went on lots of the rides, ideal for adults as well as kids. This is in an ideal situation in California, to go with the flow or just sit and relax, its all there waiting for you',\n",
       " 'I was suppose to go when I was ten years old, but my Mom wouldn’t let me go with my Grandmother...well, 38 years later I finally made it. So amazing, I’ve been to Disney World 8 times, but it was nice to finally see where it all started.',\n",
       " 'My hubby and I started going here right after we got engaged in 2013. It is never a dull moment. Since we live in Texas, for us, going to Disney is worth it since it is not a place we go to regularly. When we go, it is always clean. They offer so many different types of foods and rides, and attractions. Get there early, and you can enjoy several rides before it starts to get really busy.',\n",

       " \"We (a family of 10, ages 2-68) all visited Disneyland & California Adventure Park on February 16 & 17. It was a waste of time & money. Adventure Park: maybe 4 rides for people over the age of 7 and the waits for those rides were rediculous (1.5 - 2 hours). Many of the rides were closed or broke down during our visit. Next day at Disneyland, again rides closed, long waits, rides breaking down left and right and way too many people! We should have been told more about the parks when we purchased the tickets or even when I called in advance to ask questions. One park is primarily for little kids and the other, unless you pay for the Fastpass app and figure out how to use it quickly, don't waste your time or money going here. I personally cannot ride any rides due to medical issues, but still had to pay full price (rent for the space I took up while standing for hours waiting, possibly??)\",\n",
       " \"Finally took family to Disneyland even though they are teenagers & it was a day which brought out our inner child. It was very busy, so lines for some rides were very long so we didn't go on as many rides as we would have liked to. We also missed out on street parade, we were told it was due to renovations on Main Street. All in all had a fun family day out.\",\n",
       " \"Enjoyed the rides. Sadly didn't have many with photo ops but was great. We went on all the rides we wanted and still had time. We also enjoyed the night show. I liked the Disney gallery a lot\",\n",

       " 'Promised my mum I’d take her here for her 50th a number of years ago and thought I better keep to my word - this place is amazing no other words for it! One tip though is if you are doing other parks do this last otherwise the other will seem a bit dull in comparison to that Disney touch.',\n",
       " 'Sadly the illusion of Disneyland was greater than the reality. Our first visit was on the Monday and it was excessively packed with people, strollers and mobility scooters. The main street is under construction which made for a lot of congestion and the queues for the rides was never ending and then sadly the rides fell well below expectations. We visited the park again on the Wednesday and the crowds were reduced minimally but made for a lightly better experience but again the rides are a huge disappointment compared to a lot of the rides at other parks around the world. We enjoyed California Adventure Park a lot more and would recommend spending your time there.I was disappointed that you hardly got to see any of the Parks Characters and when we finally did see Mickey the lady had cut off the line so we missed out on a photo with him. Never saw any Disney Princesses over the two day period which again was a huge disappointment.The reality of Disneyland is over priced food, poor - average rides and lots of standing around in queues. The free Fast Pass every 2 hours worked good and that saved us a long wait on a couple of rides and we had downloaded the Disney App to be able to see what the wait times were around the park, so I definitely suggest you download that.Pack plenty of food and snacks/water in your back pack so at least you can eat while standing in the long lines!',\n",
       " \"After years of wanting to go to a Disney park it was such a disappointment. We didn't even spend the whole day there as it was pretty boring. Rides weren't that great, we saw one character in the park the whole time, the park was mainly just souvenir shops and restaurants at overcharged prices. No fireworks. No parades. Nothing that I imagined at all. The entertainment at the saloon was boring and slapstick and I am a professional performer. Waste of over 200 dollars. Truly disappointed in Disney, it just felt like a money making machine. The runaway train ride which I begrudgingly lined for hours as I knew it was a worse version of a great one we have at Alton towers at about 30 quid for the day! Don't even get me started on Space Mountain!\",\n",
       " 'It is hard not to be happy at Disneyland! The detail in everything is amazing. The food is delicious, you want to be careful because you feel the need to buy EVERYTHING and the customer service is.... well, Disney - the best out there! I would LIVE there if possible. Even the increasing (somewhat ridiculous) ticket prices will NOT stop my from my happy place. Thanks, Walt for the legacy of wonder and happiness you left the world...',\n",
       " 'Sorry to say but there were a few things Negative about this visit 1. Ticket machine jammed at entry to the park; I understand these things happen, but it took almost 20 minutes to get sorted2. No one at the ticket gate understood how the Fastpass really worked on the app3. The 3 times we went to use the fastpass the Rides were not working because of mechanical ChallengesSo basically we paid extra for fast pass and it was never used and actually irritating',\n",
       " 'where do you start, smiles, laughter, mind inspiring beauty and joy.went with 3 kids 8/ 13/ 15 and 4 adults. the enjoyment had no age limit. we have been saying we will go there for over 10 years. our experience did not disappoint. February is their winter, a great time to go as the lines are only 10-20 mins long. the weather cool but the sun warm. t-shirt and jeans each day and no issues. There was renovations on a few things but the entire park was amazing. the service, the smiles the rides all of it. Favorite ride........Starwars 4d experience and space mountain, i dont normally do rides but these two blew all my senses. most hated ride \" pirates of the Caribbean\" and the haunted mansion. the pirates ride was a hour wait most times, after arriving early one morning and lining for 10 mins we went on it. dont get me wrong amazing inside the ride, but if i had of waited any longer than 10 mins i would of been so angry. same deal with the Mansion ride. disappointed after waiting so long.Minne & mickys houses where a treat and very cool. As are the characters themselves, it was a family treat for us all to meet them. We had a 3 day park hopper and we covered all we wanted. we did 2 days Disney and 1 day 2 nights at the adventure land park. if you love rides you will need more time, but dont forget to stop and look at the park and its facade too. at night Disney streets are so stunning. the park was a dream come true, just dont spend all your time lining up for rides there is so much to see and enjoy that doesn\\'t involve a line.Shopping there was amazing, but be prepared to blow your budget. i had one teen and the star wars shop alone cost me. Not extremely expensive, but so much to choose. WE looked around and left the shopping for the last day to ensure we got what we wanted and thought it over for a day or two before spending on ever thing.even if you only do this once in your life, it is well worth it.THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH FOR SURE !!!',\n",
       " \"This trip my daughter used an electric scooter due to surgery. This park is older so some of the queues don't accommodate the scooter and you have to go to the exit. Stop at the city hall to get a map that tells you which rides you go to the exit. Once at the exit they will give you a return time to come back and ride the ride...kind of like a fast pass. We didn't find out until the last day you can have a fast pass AND a return time at the same time. We were helped by cast members at every ride because she couldn't do stairs and they gave her extra time to get into and out of the rides without being rushed. The classic rides are at this park and new ones are coming. When we visited some attractions were down (splash mountain) and they had the entire main street half blocked. It made it very difficult to navigate scooters and strollers through this area. We have been here many times and love this park. This time we experienced it a new way with the scooter and I am grateful for their accommodating help.\",\n",

       " 'The whole setting and the themes of this place is gorgeous to be in,and the rides are pretty fun too.The food is also pretty to look at and tastes good.However,even if you spend the whole day there,you could probably ride about 5 or 6 rides.The place is quite crowded which makes lines extremely long and tiring to be in.You have to stand in line for about an hour for each ride which is crazy,but besides that,the overall experience is great.',\n",
       " \"I found it difficult to find information on the fast pass system until we got there.Firstly, fast passes don't cost anything. It is just a queuing system.Not all rides are FP, only the most popular.Go the a ride that has the Fast Pass system and scan your entry ticket to get a fast pass for a particular ride. Go on other rides in the area and come back at the time shown on your fast pass and enter through the fast pass entry. As soon as you use the fast pass, get a fast pass for the next FP ride. You can only have one fast pass at a time.We were at Disneyland during a very busy time and still managed about 3 rides per hour. I love the Fast Pass system and especially love that it doesn't cost any extra. Well played, Disneyland!\",\n",

There is something for everyone! Old favorites and new experience on the horizon.bwe used the fastpass system and were able to experience everything we wanted to. It did feel more cramped with so much construction. My husband who had not been for many years enjoyed the fact there was so many places to sit.',\n",
       " 'It took me 56 years to make my first visit and it was great fun. Such an icon from my childhood watching Disneyland every Sunday night on TV. Very busy even though it was winter.

We knew to expect at least one major attraction to be down for maintenance (that day it was Splash Mountain), but by the end of the day, Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain were also shut down. These were three rides the kids were looking forward to and did not get to ride. We had a fun day, but with one day ticket prices at $120 a ticket plus $20 parking and three major rides down, it did mtake the overall “happiness” down a notch or two. Just our bad luck, I guess.

Go first thing in the morning and hit the rides you want to hit early as the lines do get long. Ride attendants were great at making sure all the seats were filled up and the lines moved as quickly as possible. Learn the fast pass system as that helps speed up the experience, although for us the most we waited was 1/2 hour.

Boy was I wrong, maybe due to the construction in Disney and some rides being down at California Adventure might have played into the over crowdedness. You can’t stop the rain but you can prepare for it! The Disney App is life! I strongly recommend using the app prior to attending the park just so you can become familiar with the app. It has a map of both parks, tells you the wait times of rides, your tickets are saved on the app, character locations, restroom locations, guest services locations and you can fastpast from the app so you don’t have to walk to the ride to get your fastpast!!! You can also make reservation from the app which was so clutch!!! If we didn’t have the app my sons first experience would’ve been a huge disaster!! Download that App!',\n",

Large walls lined both sides of the road, forcing patrons to choose which side of main st to walk on. It also caused congestion and took away from the charm of the park. Not to mention the walls were so tall and took up main st from start to finish, you couldn’t even see the Walt Disney statue or castle. Splash Mountain was also closed as they were doing work it. Additionally, parts of Small World and Fantasyland were closed. To be honest you could tell the whole park is going under a revamp. This is something Disney did not explain before going. A part of me feels like we were gipped out of the true experience. I wouldn’t pay to go here until all of the work is complete. I’m sure it will look great in the future but it was very much a let down as I know what the park could offer if all it’s sections were opened.

Space Mountain was amazing as well, but some of the other ones like the Star Wars and Buzz Lightyear rides, were ones you only had to do once.Indiana Jones was good fun.The only ride closed while we were there was the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which we'll have to catch next time.There also seemed to be a lot more characters & princesses in this section of the park, which was great for the kids.We were there during the Halloween period, and they did a great job of dressing everything up.

When we were there and they said til spring time, so something to keep in mind if you go in the next couple months. The main street is blocked off with construction. There are no parades at this time or fireworks with the castle. Knowing this before you go will help with decisions and experience. We did not know this and was a little disappointed when seeing it. However it did not ruin our experience. We had a very fun time! Spent the day. We even did a fantasmic dining package. I highly suggest.

The Indiana Jones Adventure broke down as we stood at the turnstiles to board the ride on the morning. It broke down again when we were getting ready to head back for our Fast Pass reservation near the end of the evening. Most of Paradise Pier was under construction and it’s impossible to get a reservation at a restaurant in either park. When you do, they cancel it without notice (see my review on Wine Country Trattoria). In all, for the $150 price of admission completely not worth the headache. Also, you should have left Tower of Terror alone. I love Guardians of the Galaxy and the video component is gray but ToT was very special. Guardians is just ok.

The Park was under construction. I don’t really care about that part. The park was clean and the staff was friendly. The food was not memorable. When it comes time to eat, either bring your lunch from home or go to Downtown Disney. It is a nice perk that they allow you to bring in your own food. We also like they they would give you free water cups with ice upon request. I would be just fine if I didn’t come back to Disneyland. There isn’t anything here that is worth what you pay for.',\n",
       " 'We went to Disneyland for two days in late Jan / early Feb and it did not disappoint. Top highlights include: the character breakfast at the Plaza Inn, the classic Haunted House and Pirates of the Caribbean rides, the recently updated It’s a small world ride, and finally the numerous character meet and greet opportunities. During this trip, we brought along our 2.5 yr old toddler so we did slant towards the more child-friendly rides. However, the new Disneyland app meant upgrading to Maxpass for ease of booking Fastpasses and keeping unlimited digital photos very worthwhile. We were able to go on more adult themed rides and switch on and off thanks to the convenience of the Fastpass and Rider Switch option. Regarding the character breakfast, it may seem expensive, however it meant we were able to take pictures with at least six characters while eating and this not have to spend twenty minutes or more lining up for each character in the park. There are dozens of characters in the park, so reducing the number of characters we had to line up for meant more time for rides. Additionally, if you go for the breakfast charger meal, the Mickey Mouse waffles are quite excellent. If you are willing to sit down for lunch, the monte cristo sandwich in the New Orleans area is very worth it! The kids meal at Cafe Orleans is also very sizeable and has many healthy fruit and vegetable options. Regarding renovations, while we knew this was a period of time in which some rides would undergo renovations and would this be closed, we didn’t anticipate that the entire streetcar rail system on Main St was also going to be under renovation. This resulted in the whole centre section of Main St being boarded up and left the area rather cramped. Some of the rides in the park were definitely showing their age as we had three cases in which rides broke down and we had to vacate them. These rides included: the roger rabbit ride in toon town, the Pinocchio ride, and the snow white ride. Finally, some of the older rides are not as small children friendly as you might think. In particular, the Snow White, mr. toad, and pinnochio rides were all very dark and mainly featured more of the scary scenes than memorable ones.',\n",

We only encountered one staff member who was a bit abrasive when we explained our troubles but then offered us some fast passes to compensate.',\n",
       " 'Most expensive place on earth! Paid over $4000 for 3 nights at Disneyland Grand Californian, 2 day Park passes for 3 people (two adults one toddler). Bought the max pass in addition and ate every meal on premises. Extraordinarily expensive and low value. There were 5 rides broken throughout the Saturday Feb 10 (Snow white, Pinocchio, Star Wars, Roger Rabbit, Small World) that we know of. This causes the lines at working rides to double/triple in length. Received Bonus multi fast pass on app because one of the rides was broken. Nice! But Wanted to use it at Small World and told we couldn’t because the fast pass machine was broken!! At every turn, even when Disney tried to make it right, it failed. Also, Disney won’t tell you the ENTIRE railway system on main street and castle area is 100% under construction across the park so the crowds have no where to go. There is no mention of this at time Of booking with the Disney travel agent by the way” and they charge you the same. January is typically construction time but it’s now mid Feb. Unacceptable. The staff were average at best as even said to us “we are breaking down”. Ate character breakfast at Park with Mini, made reservations, etc sat us in corner, no one cleared our plates until we were 100% done, and food was greasy and low quality. Disney will gladly take your money, treat you average and not tell you they should discount their prices because they sell something that is subpar. Their Tomorrowland is 1970’s Star Wars. The submarine ride is 1970’s 20,000 leagues under the sea now with Nemo holograms. Old. But if they were to improve something, they should invest more money in their app. We still had paper/plastic tickets and none of our stay was linked to the app automatically. It should all be automated! Systems are not talking to each other and it shows. Not seamless. They are running an average operation at best and over selling it based on their reputation. Disney corporate should take note of the poor reviews on Trip Advisor. I don’t even see any comments fromDisney management on Trip Advisor explaining the situation. So, sorry, but the Disney magic is gone for me in California. My recommendation is to look for another park or another vacation location to spend your hard earned dollars. Disneyland lost its luster and its simply not worth the money anymore. The park is aging and it needs a major redo to keep up with the times. Walt would be disappointed. Maybe try Florida.',\n",

You can take a look at this ahead of time on Disney’s website though.',\n",

Why would anyone wait in line if they could avoid it?Always get to the park early, the touring plans in the guide will set it out for you.I took my two kids, one 19 years old daughter and my six year old son. We haven’t been since my daughter was 6. So much has changed. One of the things we noticed the revamp of the rides and it was for the better, but made me miss the originals Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse is now Tarzan too Also, the Peter Pan ride broke down at least twice, Toad’s Wild Ride did too. The line for Peter Pan was over 35 Mins all day long maybe a Fast Pass is needed to be implemented for this... Also the line for characters never below 30 Mins. Crazy. We didn’t want to wait in any character lines if we paid well over $100 a ticket! No way!Another thing we both noted is the friendliness of the people that worked there. I rarely saw a smile or even an acknowledgement of my son wearing his “1st visit” pin. Actually only one cast member said something about it. The ones we did encounter were kind of grouchy. We had a very expensive lunch at the New Orleans area with a horrible tasting shrimp po’boy where I asked for ketchup for my son’s chicken, and they rolled their eyes. I then went back out to the cart where five people pointed, and went back inside and told them no that’s tobasco, so someone came and pulled it out from under the cart. I am a happy, nice person from Texas and to experience lack of warmth and I guess just overall lack of helpfulness is strange.All in all, we had a good time.

       " 'I have dreamed of visiting Disneyland ever since I was a little girl! My husband and I have recently travelled from Australia to go & whilst we loved each bit - I cannot give it 5 stars for a few reasons! First being, so many rides were closed! Including the iconic big white roller coaster in the ‘New’ California Disneyland. Being a low season, I imagine the crowds were smaller than usual, but the park was still very crowded and line times on most rides were 30-60min wait times. I’d hate to see it during peak season! In saying this, we do plan to one day return in peak season (so we can bring our one day children & go on all the rides without them being closed down!). But two words for anyone planning to go at any time of the year - FAST PASS! Not sure how much extra they are, we didn’t bother getting one because most of the rides we wanted to go on were closed. But it’s my hot tip (along with getting a park hopper ticket, so you can visit both parks). Overall, we had a magical experience! Loved it & can not wait to one day return.',\n",
       " 'A lot of people wrote reviews of Disneyland. This one is for anyone accompanying kids with special needs. As soon as you enter the park, go to City Hall and register the party for Return Passes. Usually one person per party has to be the carrier of the Return Passes but you can have them designate another person if your party plan different attractions. You can combine Return Passes with Fastpass so you can maximize your visit. There are 5 spots around the park marked with green umbrellas where you can reserve the attraction with Return Pass. They give you a return time usually better than the Fastpass, you go then to the attraction and use either the exit (for Pirates of the Carribean) or the Fastpass entrance. Once you’re done with the ride, you can book the next ride with Return Pass. Beware that you can’t book more than one ride at a time with Return Pass. But, as I said before, you can combine it with Fastpass. So if you do a little planning ahead (and use the app that shows you wait times) you can actually do a lot of rides with minimum wait time. My advice is to start with Tomorrow Land since Star Tours fills up pretty quickly. We’ve done this a few times and always ended up doing much of what we had planned to do.',\n",

       " \"We spent three days at Disneyland and California adventure park and 'almost' did all the rides. There really is a lot of information on the internet about how to 'do' Disneyland and we read quite a bit of it. The 'tips' that worked for us mostly related to using fastpass. Though it must be said that fastpass can be a nuisance if you end up with a late return time for an attraction which we did on one occasion as you can't get another fastpass in the same area until that one has been used. We also used 'magic morning' to our advantage by going straight to the fastpass line for Radiator races, meaning we avoided a long queue later in the day as fastpasses ran out and the standard queue got long.We are told that we went at one of the quietest times for disneyland, hence the longest we waited was around 40 minutes for the Indiana Jones ride. We noted that from mid-afternoon the crowds grew and the lines subsequently increased.Food was as we expected, expensive and some areas of the park seemed to have very little choice. Toontown was very short on food options.Merchandise was equally expensive - they certainly make their money on the likes of mouse ears at $25USD.We managed 90%+ of the rides but we didn't do any of the shows, so there is a bit of a tradeoff. My sister and her family went to quite a few of the shows but did hardly any rides - so each to their own.So what would we tell others? 1) buy a lanyard for your ticket outside of the park - they were a horrendous price inside disneyland.2) ask for water at the restaurants, to save on fizzy.3) my wife took a camelbak filled with ice and water that she used each day.4) Try everything - you may as well do a ride, rather than walk past one - thinking you might do it later.5) Buy your merchandise somewhere other than disney - our hotel had a large selection of disney gear, all cheaper.6) Don't go home before dark - the park really is magical at night with all the lights.7) There were no parades or fireworks whilst we were there - they don't start until April and they are apparently amazing.8) The guardians of the galaxy ride was the tower of terror - wish I'd known this before we went on it ; )9) If you need help - ask. All the staff we talked to were super helpful. We had my mum with us, who is in a wheelchair - staff went out of their way to make things easier for her when and where it was possible.10) if you are from overseas as we are, stay from dawn til dusk because it is the experience of a lifetime and one that will most likely never happen again.\",\n",

The lady in the shop comes walking up to me and says, \"I need to confiscate that selfie stick.\" I asked why and she was rude with her explanation enough for another guest, a mom with her child, interrupted to help me. She even explained that it wasn\\'t a selfie stick but a tripod. After the mom helped me, the older lady employee let me go to take it to lost and found, where they said I was okay to take it into the park. They just reminded me to not use it like a selfie stick. I agreed and went into the park. It was too much of a hassle for me to even take it out of my purse again. Both the security and the lost and found were great with customer service! The older lady might have been having a bad day. I was in Disneyland the happiest place on earth and my favorite place on earth, so I let it go because I didn\\'t want this incident to damper my visit especially because it was my first time with my boyfriend.

       " 'So, we’ve returned from our trip to the USA and the West Coast, a trip that ended with a Five day visit to Disneyland in Anaheim.For the benefit of those of you who have only ever made the journey to Walt Disney World near Orlando, is a trip to Disneyland worth it, or can you get much of the same experiences in Central Florida?Firstly, Disneyland is made-up of only two theme parks, one of which, Disney California Adventure, had a troubled and frustrating gestation before finally getting itself on track only in recent years. Disney’s keystone in California is Disneyland itself, the original 1955 park that took elements from existing American theme parks and pleasure gardens, and perfectly fused them together into ‘the’ definitive family entertainment destination.Walt Disney World in Florida was an effort to break free of the historic limitations of the California site and, over the years, has expanded to a total of four parks across enormous acreage. The most recognisable park is Magic Kingdom and it is this park that is a homage to Disneyland. Elements are shared between the parks, but none are true replicas of one another, gentle facsimiles persist, but many seemingly familiar attractions have slight differences, and many attractions are unique to one location or the other.Disneyland and Magic Kingdom are therefore closely related, while California Adventure shares some of its heritage with the content of Disney’s other Florida offerings: Hollywood Studios, EPCoT and, Animal Kingdom.From a purely package holiday perspective WDW wins, with a much larger size, it’s much more capable of sustaining a family vacation for a much longer visit (the typical two-weeks that British visitors are likely to book). There are other benefits too; multiple Disney owned hotels, on-site restaurants aplenty, water parks, shopping & entertainment, and close by, Universal Florida and SeaWorld too. WDW is cleverly designed to act as the hub for all of your holiday needs and is increasingly, with dining packages, digital ticketing, multiple pre-bookable attractions, and experiences, a completely integrated Disney experience from sun-up to sun-down.Disneyland is a very different experience to its upstart younger sibling and this is where some very surprising elements reveal themselves.For starters Disneyland is small, though they may look similar, Magic Kingdom is quite a bit larger, and Cinderella’s Castle in Florida is massive when compared to Anaheim’s original Sleeping Beauty Castle. The limited scale of Disneyland was a necessity of the constraints of the original site and of Walt being unable to afford more land when embarking on the project. With finances tight, Disneyland was soon hemmed-in by hotels, restaurants, and vacant lots purchased by speculative real-estate developers. Over the years, Disneyland’s designers have become adept at squeezing attractions into an increasingly full plot, the result is a surprisingly intimate experience that WDW seeks to duplicate but, because of its more generous size and despite using clever tricks with scale and perspective, doesn’t quite manage to replicate. Disneyland still has Walt’s influence around every corner and, though planned and conceived by him, WDW didn’t even break ground until after Walt’s deathSecondly, Disneyland is much more of a local’s park; that’s not to say that hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors, or those from across much of the USA don’t venture to Anaheim, it’s just that the overwhelming majority of visitors are from the LA and Southern California conurbation and this lends the park a more casual vibe. Many Californian’s are day visitors or just there on short stays, and the popularity of annual passes mean that many can drop-in for an afternoon or evening visit almost any day of the week. Attendance levels can therefore fluctuate dramatically, at times outside of peak demand, particularly during mid-week, the parks can be remarkably quiet compared to Florida. Walt Disney World is becoming much more of a year-round destination to the point where crowds are flattening-out and periods that have historically benefitted from low attendances are starting to get squeezed.The next difference is in the time you may want to dedicate to visiting the parks. Disneyland Resort (that’s Disneyland and the neighbouring Disney California Adventure) can be attempted, at the right time of year, in just two days (one day for each park). In some favourable circumstances, a reasonable taster of both parks can even be managed in a single day! This opens-up Disney as a vacation excursion destination, something that can be added, but need not dominate, a busy schedule spent visiting Los Angeles, San Diego or other Californian cities and landmarks. General Admission theme park tickets start with single day options and top out at five day passes, remember to specify park-hopper tickets if you wish to skip between both parks in a single day. So, Disneyland works well as an addition to any trip that brings you to California, rather than necessarily being the focus of a long vacation. WDW is a destination that visitors commit multiple days to, with one and two week visits increasingly popular, and except for a few days at Universal Florida, many people never leave the boundaries of the Florida resort at all.Finally there are attractions in California that you won’t find in Florida and some special takes on some familiar WDW favourites that are exclusive to Anaheim. Here are some of your exclusives:Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye – a high speed truck ride through a South American treasure templeThe Matterhorn Bobsleds – the world’s first tubular steel rollercoaster that winds its way through the iconic Matterhorn Mountain that borders FantasylandFinding Nemo Submarine Voyage – the famous Disney submarines given a Pixar MakeoverGuardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout – the extremely clever and uniquely re-themed Hollywood Tower of TerrorCars Land – the phenomenal multi-million dollar recreation of Radiator Springs, featuring three unique attractions centred on the popular characters from the Cars films including the amazing Radiator Springs Racers.Paradise Pier and California Screamin’ – currently undergoing a reimagining as Pixar Pier and The Incredicoaster (themed on the Incredibles, just in time for the film’s sequel)Grizzly Peak – a water raft ride through a Californian National ParkMickey’s Toontown – a mash-up between the worlds of Disney Animation and Who Framed Roger RabbitThe World of Color – A spectacular water fountain show held on the lake in California Adventure and enhanced with pyrotechnics, lasers, and animated projectionsAdded to these, are some attractions that manage to beat their duplicates:Haunted Mansion – from Halloween thru Christmas, this attraction is exclusively redecorated to include special theming from: “A Nightmare Before Christmas”, turning-it into a unique attraction that makes Florida theme park fans extremely jealousPirates of the Caribbean – This is the superior US version of the classic, with better drops and better loading and unloading (just don’t look at the Shanghai Disneyland version)It’s a Small World – The Disneyland original features the iconic clock and the original world’s fair outdoor beginning absent from the WDW editionSo, should you visit Disneyland? Our opinion is yes, just with some conditions. If you are visiting California, definitely try and add it to your list; you’ll just have to determine how much time you’ll want to spend there. We recommend between two and three days in low season and midweek, if you’re visiting in high season, the two parks can get quite full and the only guarantee of seeing and riding everything may be to stretch a visit out to four or five days – depending of course, on just how ‘Disney’ you are.There’s no dining-plan at Disneyland and the park dining is limited when compared to WDW, but there are a few great restaurants inside the gates (reserve using the Disneyland App) and some reasonable offerings nearby.If you’re familiar with WDW, you won’t find magic-bands or advance fast passes in California, but there have been recent changes to introduce a little technological ticket management to Disneyland. For a $10 per guest daily supplement, guests can now link their park tickets to their Disney Account using the Disneyland App, benefits include an unlimited photo-pass, and fast pass reservations that won’t require a visit to the attraction to get a time.Tying Disney to a visit to Universal Studios in Hollywood is not as practical as the Florida Equivalent, as the parks are on opposite sides of LA and the traffic on the freeway between the two destinations can be torturous. Another great theme park experience, Six Flags Magic Mountain, in Valencia, is even further away, to the North of Los Angeles. Our advice, should you wish to add Universal and Six Flags to your itinerary, use a hotel near to Hollywood or Universal City and stay a few nights there using that as your base, before moving on to Anaheim.If you’re looking for another theme park experience closer to Disneyland, you can visit Knott’s Berry Farm, also in Anaheim and just a few minutes away. Disney doesn’t offer any water parks at Disneyland, but nearby Knott’s Berry Farm does have a reasonable offering in the shape of Soak City and Six Flags has the excellent Hurricane Harbor (both open seasonally).So, for us Disneyland is a gem. Yes, inevitably, there is a lot of duplication between California and Florida, but there’s still plenty of unique experiences too. Despite the clamour from some Disney fans that the company should replicate everything in both locations, Disney is clever enough to know that allowing each resort to have its share of exclusive attractions allows them to have a distinctive character. It’s this approach that makes a visit to either location such a different and worthwhile experience.Footnote: My wife and I took our first holiday together to California, Disneyland was my first experience of a Disney park (California Adventure was still the parking lot at the time), despite having been to WDW lots of times since, Disneyland remains my favourite Disney Park, after all, they say that you never forget your first time…',\n",

Thrilling rides include Indiana Jones (most thrilling and arguably best ride. Matterhorn bobsled as well was great with some surprise around the corners. The shows are actually fantastic - Abe Lincoln, royal theatre (and I loved reliving my favourite Disney classics as they redid tangled and beauty and the beast but in a theatre like, Comedic way), laughing house, tiki room (omg didn't expect that to be so good),You can't beat meeting the Disney princesses for girls who grew up with Disney and they were as awesome as my imagination, they stayed in character even when I asked them weird questions haha.

       " 'Husband & I had very fond memories of previous visits to Disneyland which we had hoped to share with our 3 teenage chn however the excessive number of people let into the park meant HUGE queues for everything (I’m talking 2-3 hour waits for a single ride).

       " 'First trip for our family of four. Our two girls are 9 and 11. We had a great time. It was off season so lines and crowd not too bad. Many attractions closed and no fireworks though. Our kids were the right age to enjoy both the kid and adult rides. We did 2 day park hopper which was just right for us. We had already played tourist in San Diego for 5 days. Cast members all friendly, most even wished our youngest happy birthday. The disney app with max pass was easy to use and with it the only line we waited in was for Peter pan with no fast pass. Fantasmic was a treat but hard for the kids to see because of adults stepping in front of them. All and all a good trip. Not quite 5 stars because of the attractions closed for refurbishment and several rides closed while were waiting and even on them (stuck for 20 minutes in middle of Indiana jones)',\n",

       " 'First thing you need to do is download the disneyland app and get MaxPass. It\\'s the new digital form of fastpass and will enable you to get fast passes without having to actually go to the ride to get them--saves time. Worth every penny--it\\'s $10/per pass. The second you get into the park and your tickets are scanned you can start using it. You will use your phone as your Maxpass to scan when you enter the ride. Also FYI--this will drain your cell battery, so have a backup battery or carry a portable charger. Definitely utilize the MaxPass so you aren\\'t wasting time just walking around the park.  40\" in height is the magic number for most of Disney\\'s roller coasters. Big Thunder, Star Tours, & Space Mountain. Matterhorn is 42\". If your child is not over the height limit, you can utilize the rider switch pass. Just tell a cast member that you need one and then One parent can go on ride with a child and then switch with your friend or spouse once they return without waiting in line. There are multiple parades over the day and seating fills up quickly. It goes from Small World to down Main street and most people try to sit down Main street, the right side of the castle in between Matterhorn and Alice in Wonderland--better viewing and doesn\\'t fill up as quickly. At the entrance there are park maps and the daily schedule of parades as it changes everyday, so be sure to grab one. Plus it will also be on the app. The parades are exactly the same so my suggestion is to pick one to watch and then utilize the shorter lines in fantasyland during the other one. Upon your arrival--stop by City Hall (right inside the entrance on the left hand side) and get a birthday button and the rest of you can get \"I\\'m celebrating\" buttons. Also, my personal opinion...the best place to see the fireworks is by the entrance in front of the train station. They do projections on the store fronts down main street that you can\\'t see unless you are further back and you get the full view of the effect that way..( I received all of this feedback from my friend Michele and agree with her :) We love the park. It’s worth every penny if you plan your day. Last thing you want to do is wonder around. The day goes by quick.',\n",

We grew up with those disney movies and for my kids it is not so different either. It took us 2 days to complete the two disney parks covering most rides. My daughter loved the princess and my son loved the thunder mountain railway, haunted mansion, tower of terror.Fast passes made our lives easy but fo use them wisely. Loved the ambience, the crowd and activities all around the parks. Easy to move around with strollers and so many restaurants and food stalls to keep your tummy satisfied. Note of advice, take some snacks and water bottles with you when traveling with young children, as you will be spending the whole day. Make sure to stay till the end if you want to see the shows and fireworks.',\n",

We went during summer time which was super crowded. We were used to going around October when weather is slightly cooler and lines shorter than the usual summer break in June. Cons: expensive whether it's a single park multiple days ticket or a multiple days hopper tickets. To top it off, staying at the Grand California hotel was not cheap too (however, I liked that we had easy access to the park), lines are always long, waited 50 minutes for peter pan-ridiculous), food and drinks expensive, everything pricey!! Pros: FUN FUN FUN, it never gets old.\",\n",
       " 'We purchased a 5 day park hopper for our family of 5 and we had the best time at Disney during our vacation!! Our youngest son (6) broke his foot a week prior to vacation and Disney was very accommodating. For two days we rented a wheelchair on site but found the travel from our hotel to the wheelchair rental a long way for our little guy to use his crutches. We ended up renting a wheelchair from our hotel and Disney had no problem with us bringing it into the park. They no longer require you to get a pass for mobility issues as the wheelchair is evident enough. This allowed us to get return times, enter through special entrances and sometimes skip a bit of the line. They try to be as fair as possible with the people who are waiting normally but in some cases we flew through the lines much faster. The park is incredibly clean. There is never a piece of popcorn on the ground for long as people are continuously cleaning. The food and drinks in the park are insanely expensive, but of course we ate them. There is a snack cart or a beverage stand or a restaurant around every turn. It was nice we never really had to search for food or washrooms as they are all over the place. Unfortunately the water rides were closed as this is their downtime so we never got those but everything else was great. Download the app and take advantage of the info on there! Also, everyone there is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The popcorn cart employee knew exactly where the next churro stand was so my boy could get the treat he was eyeing. Everyone will stop to help and answer questions. It truly is the most magical place to be and we recommend the five day hopper so you can take in all that Disney has to offer!!',\n",
       " 'After doing Orlando a couple of years ago I admit I was a little apprehensive about this one. I couldn’t see how it was going to measure up. My initial fears were met as I walked in and saw the castle, it’s TINY! I was thinking ‘omg this is going to be terrible’. I’d say after about another ten minutes all concerns had left and I had the best day ever! Try not to think and compare it to Orlando. I loved its charm of being the first Disney park and it being a little smaller (still didn’t fit it all into a day) and the Fantasmic show at the end gave me goosebumps. The magic of Disney is very much alive here, all the workers were 5 star and really add to your experience as you would expect, the park is stunning and whilst there isn’t an option to buy an upgrade for a queue jump ticket the facility they have for free is really efficient! My tips would be make sure you stay til the end to see the show! Use your fast passes wisely, if there is a ride with a fast pas and you have a three hour wait, check another ride with a shorter time, go on that fast pass and then get the last longer fast pass. As I left the park walking through the little castle I actually changed my mind and loved that they’ve kept it smaller and how it originally was, it shows how far the theme parks have developed, it would be boring if all of the parks were the same.',\n",

       " \"First off- I am a huge Disney fan and for me it has such roots in the Anaheim area and with Walt Disney's original vision that it is a must see.I visited on a Monday toward the end of January and it was extremely busy- I think it's similar to Tokyo Disney in that it has a very densely populated area with lots of AP holder's who are willing to take the day off (or take advantage of goverment shutdown!) and spend time at DIsney. The park did handle the numbers well however it does make the whole experience more stressful, especially when you don't expect it.The park itself is a blend of the classic Disney rides from Alice in Wonderland through to Buzz Lightyears's Astro Blasters set into well laid out zones which are all very distinctive. There are a good range of restaurants both sit down and counter service however I would definitely make a reservation if you're looking at one of the waiter service restaurants. I was disappointed in the gift shops as there wasn't really anything special that was different- I thought especially with it being the original Disney park, they would make more of that rather than standard gift shop fare you can find in Paris or Hong Kong.I think ultimately for me, Disney will always give you a day out that's different and special however I think this park has lost its way a little bit and for that reason I would probably head to Knott's Berry Farm instead for my next visit.\",\n",

Our kids even picked up on this and told us about how they felt about it. Like they didn’t have time for you they just wanted to talk to each other rude staff members.So help or lack of it made that what was new and or where we could get our handicap person on this ride or not uncomfortable to say the least.To many employees together seemed to just stand around togetherness and talked,we did find a few employees at it’s a small world to help and goofy kitchen staff was a great help to us.We missed the nights fireworks as we didn’t know about the time it was taking place and we were coming back from dinner at goofys kitchen wonderful staff clean comfortable as I said and saw the very end,we would have gone back sooner if we had got the right answer to what time fireworks display was going to happen. We talked as family oh well we saw little of the end from the tram ride back so better then not at all.we tried to make the best of all and have wonderful vacation on earth.Ice cream pineapple treats was great while waiting to get In to see singing birds a must to try and we all loved it worth it oh yes indeed. Enjoy the jungle ride ,submarine,cars ,toon town, pirates of the Caribbean , riverboat ride,shops, once you got into parking garage it was spacious clean comfortable to get into next area to get bags check out and then on a ride over to park all came together. Long lines to get in to park but that’s nothing new .We all talked on way home and we will go back but we are going to have to have better service and help on our visit.Maybe it’s not this bad all the time.We went away with will give it another try before we say no way Universal and warner brothers is so much more fun.Kids and adults love the fun had at other two places in the past.',\n",

Had no regard to my belonging being soiled in her fish smelling vomit. I had done my best to wipe it clean but it still smelled, I walked to guest services explaining my problem and they had no suggestion, I asked for a complimentary locker so I didn’t have to carry it around with me and gross myself and others out anymore and they said I would have to pay!

       " 'Our iPhone app showed we walked almost 8 miles on the day we were in Disneyland. Phew! Didn’t feel so all day. That says it all. We were there on the 26th of December 2017. You can imagine the crowd situation. Had to wade through the crowds almost all day from the time we entered till the late night we left from there. A few things we tried and learnt. 1. There are several restaurants in 2mile distance. We took a Lyft taxi (just for $4). Had a proper dinner and went back to Disney. That was a good 1 hr break and amazing food compared to the fast food and expensive ones at Disney. More so the waiting time. Only draw back is the walking to the main entrance. But it is worth the effort. 2. Pack some good snacks especially if you’re there with kids. They did allow our food items although we had read a few reviews saying outside food would not be allowed. We did have a few sandwiches, cookies and a little rice. This was handy to have some quick bites in between rides when we anyway knew we would be waiting in the queue. 3. Make sure you carry a battery power bank for the phone. We need to keep checking the Disney app for fast pass times for many rides often. Make sure you have the Disney app installed on multiple phones and use the same login so your fast passes are available on multiple phones. This would be handy as a back up plan when one phone is dead. 4. We didn’t have much time to plan in advance. But a little bit of research and watching videos in advance would have helped in zeroing in on the top rides. We didn’t have time for Indiana Jones. The wait time was almost 1.5 to 2 hours for most of the time. Had we known in advance we would have probably gone there in the morning. Splash mountain is top of the rank for my family. My older daughter and I did this three times. It’s such a fun. You will be very wet if you are on the front seat. Better carry some ponchos. Our ponchos were very helpful in keeping the backpacks and purses from getting wet. We didn’t care so much about ourselves getting wet so much. 5. There is a special light show in the night. For this one we need to get physical tickets even if you have the fast pass. I didn’t know that before. These tickets help you have front seats with better view. We ended up standing at the far end and watching it but it was very difficult. My wife and I had to hold up our kids so they have a better view. The lighting show on the castle is way too good. Please don’t miss this. This is open to all. Make sure you are aware of the show timings on that day and plan to be there well in advance. 6. Lastly. Arrive early. Take breaks. Stay till late evening. If you are concerned kids will be tired and you may not be able to stay longer, don’t be. We are a good example. We were there early and retuned to the hotel at midnight. Take it easy. Enjoy. I am sure we will go back to Disney in a few years.',\n",

They were at the gate am hour before us even though we parked at the same time. There was a long line to get into the garage, long line for security and a long line to get on the tram to get to the park. Luckily the sp5p lets us know when fast passes are available and told us wait times so we could choose which rides were worth waiting for. We also used the single rider lines which saved us a ton of time. The rides were a blast and the kids had a great time. They all liked Disneyland over Legoland. Space mountain is still my favorite ride, and now it's the kids favorite too. Maybe not worth an hour plus wait so be sure to get a fast pass early in the day as they do sell out, or go single rider.

There were many rides that were down and many arts of the park were walled off for construction in both parks Really there were too many things closed to warrant the high ticket price, but you have no choice. We did most of Disneyland park te first day. GET THERE EARLY TO BE ON THE GOOD RIDES - the afternoon its almost impossible even with a fast pass. We paid the big bucks for the Desert Party at the World of Color in the other park. It was worth it and would recommend. The Carnation Cafe has really gone downhill so I'd hits the restaurants near Pirates for better service and food.Al in all is SOOO much different and less magical than when my wife and I were kids.

       " \"My husband and I took a couples vacation and he had never been to Disney. As it was the end of August, it was a little quieter, except the Sunday when the Annual Passholders could get in for the first time in some time. It was also extremely hot, so there were some issues with some of the rides and the monorail wasn't working, but honestly NONE of that mattered. Disneyland is magical no matter what. My husband hats crowds and waiting, so we invested in the MaxPass every day. The pictures alone were worth it! We haven't had a photo together that isn't a selfie in so long and we got over 100 on this trip. It was awesome! The shorter wait for rides also allowed us to do so much more, which we both appreciated. I should note we did the Park Hopper and you could book Fastpasses across parks, which meant we could do Disneyland rides, while holding two fastpasses in DCA for later in the day. It was great!\",\n",
       " 'This is our second visit to Disneyland, and the park is still worth a visit. Only downside for us has been that on both visits - once in August and now January the Haunted House has been closed.We hadn’t thought that with it being winter rides would be closed for servicing. Despite the number of rides being closed or down (one was supposed to be open but hadn’t tested properly in the morning) we still had a great time. Prices for food and drink have gone up since we visited 4 years ago but are still cheaper than Australian theme parks.',\n",
       " 'What can we say about this place that has not been said before.It’s was crowded during Christmas and the fireworks was canceled due to winds. What a let down. The rides in line were up to 2 hours and if you want peace and quiet this is not the place during Christmas. Avoid it at all cost.',\n",
       " 'We arrived at 8am and stayed until closing and were pretty much able to see everything in the day. Note if it’s theme park rides you are looking for then head to the adventure park but as an experience with some rides and various attractions and activities then this is the place to go.Plenty to see and do and lines are well managed. Food and beverage venues are varied and plentiful and generally pretty easy to get a seat.Fireworks were cancelled the night we were there due to weather but the lights etc are still very good. As I said can be done in a day or if you have a three day pass go to Disneyland resort and adventure park on one day each then come back on day three for anything you missed. But for us one long day was enough to experience Disneyland.',\n",
       " 'Really enjoyed my first trip to Disney. Its expensive as you would expect but no real complaints as you get what you expect.',\n",
       " 'I used to love Disneyland. I have taken my family to Disneyland every year for about the past 9 Years. It used to feel like the Happiest Place on Earth...not anymore. Our first day at Disneyland I spent 2 hours trying to park at Disneyland. Then when my family goes to get into the park Disneyland closed the gate next to us as we are next to go in and tell the 15 or so people next to us to get in line in front of us even though we were next. We visited California Adventures we were able to go on all the rides that were open the first day. I bought a 2 day pass this time 1 Park per day which we wasted half of our 1st day trying to park. It seems like half the rides are closed at Disneyland land and California Adventures while I New most of the rides were closed when we went it made the parks really crowded. We stood in line to see Captain America and again we were next in line to see him and they allowed some other guests not in line to walk up and see him before us. I’m guessing they had some kind of VIP status. I guess if you are rich you are treated better at Disneyland now. We went to Disneyland the next day the crowds were out of Control, the lines seemed ridiculous for being January midweek. Just wondering what we are paying for these days??? The park still seemed pretty clean. I was super disappointed that you now have to have a fast pass to see the Fantasmic show. It used to be my favorite but we missed it this trip because I didn’t know they now had a fast pass for that too. Like a lot of others I also agree that Disneyland is falling apart and no longer tries to make everyone have a great experience.',\n",
       " 'The best time to visit Disneyland is when it rains. The crowds are at a minimum. Instead of waiting in 2 hour lines they are 15 to 20 minutes. Just wear appropriate rain gear & enjoy! Make sure you also wear comfortable shoes. We walked 8 1/2 miles one day. Once the rain stopped some of the rides that were closed opened & we were able to walk right on. We rode everything & many twice. My favorites are Big Thunder Mountain, The Tiki Room, The Jungle Cruise, Star Tours & The Train Ride around the park. The Park is unbelievably clean given the amount of people who visit. It also has enough bathrooms scattered throughout the Park. If you plan to eat there make sure you have a churro, corn dog & a dole whip. Yummy goodness! Also be prepared for expensive food & drinks.',\n",
       " \"Disneyland is great! Apart from it being rediculously expensive, the staff do a pretty great job of making sure your visit is a happy one. They clean the park constantly, it's amazing how they keep up. The food is decent although very pricey. They make sure the kids get fruit/veggies and other drinks besides soda with their meals which I really appreciated. The rides are outstanding and although you have to wait so long for some, there is always something to look at in the lines. The front gate entrance was an issue almost every morning. I feel they would move a lot faster if they separated those who had already had their pictures taken from those who were visiting for the first time. Taking pictures for a family of 5 or more requires a lot of time. They could have staff walking through the line weeding out those who need pictures and putting it in the system while we wait, as opposed to just letting it all happen at the entrance which is so time consuming and holds up the line--Especially for those who have their pictures linked to the their tickets and are eagerly waiting to start their day. Always room for improvement in some areas such as this. Hopefully they can find a way to fix this.\",\n",
       " \"Yesterday Fri Jan 19 was the first time my partner and I had ever visited Disneyland. A few notes:- We parked at the Mickey and Friends building, $20 flat rate for the day, and a 10 min walk or 5 min tram ride to the park. Not bad.- Started with Adventureland and made our way round clockwise, finishing with Tomorrowland. This meant we walked straight onto Indiana Jones, and had only 5-10 min waits for Pirates of the Carribean and Haunted Mansion. Our longest wait of the day was 1.5 hours for Space Mountain which wasn't worth it IMO, but you have to go to know. - There are virtually no characters roaming around anymore, as apparently they get mobbed and disrupt the flow of guests. You will need to go to special themed areas like Mickey's house to see them. This took a bit of the Disney out of it for us, and made the place feel like just another theme park.- The whole park was immaculate! I counted one lolly wrapper and 2 empty drink bottles the entire time we were there. - We showed up with no plan at all for where to go or what rides to go on, used no Fastpasses at all, and still managed to cover the whole park in 10 hours. However it was a weekday in winter, Splash Mountain was closed, and we skipped the Matterhorn and just strolled through Storybookland apart from King Arthur's Carousel and the boat cruise. Still, the Fastpasses are a great idea. They cost nothing and will cut your wait times in half or more.Overall it was a great visit, just slightly let down by the lack of characters and/or Disney feel if that makes sense.\",\n",
       " 'I was lucky enough to visit Disneyland from Australia as a child, as was my husband. This trip was to continue the family tradition and it did not disappoint! We brought our 2 daughters aged 8 and 10. There really is no more magical place in the world. I planned carefully before my trip to maximise our time in the park. Had such an amazing time that we are adding another visit to our Canada trip at the end of 2018...just have to see the holiday decorations :-)Words cannot describe the magic!!',\n",
       " 'We used to be season pass holders and we are not from California. I see it progressively declining with each visit, bit this last one was the worst. Not only are the prices for everything from parking ($20) to horrible food ridiculous, bit the cast members have lost their magic. We had multiple rude cast members this time. We were going to upgrade our tickets to add more days bit after this experience, no thanks.',\n",
       " 'Oh my gods. I had been waiting 25 years to go here. It did NOT disappoint. Rides were amazing! Even lining up for them was part of the experience. Smart Pass makes getting onto the really popular rides such a breeze.The park itself is SO well maintained. Clean, well-cared for, and easy to get around. The cast members who help load riders on and off rides were so efficient, there was no fuss. Things are so well-run, and they have just thought of all the little things. There are roving photographers all over the place, who will take your photo in front of particular attractions, or with characters. You can then buy those photos, or hand over your own camera or phone and the photographers will take a few extra shots on those. Also other little niceties like the baby swap and ride area at the rides, so if you have two people visiting with a baby, there is a waiting area for one person to wait with the bub while their partner rides, then you switch for the next run of the ride. Not that I was using that facility, but I just thought it was so thoughtful that they made that available! The food stalls and restaurants were also amazing. I could have eaten at all of them! They have so many different options - pretzels and beignets being my favourite of the snacks! Overall, worth it. Grown ups and kids of all ages were enjoying themselves, and the whole place lived up to all my expectations!',\n",
       " 'Not too busy at the moment in Disney great weather and quick wait times with the fast pass.What can I say but it truly is a land of its own. A definite fast pass is the Indiana Jones ride in Adventure land and the Thunder railway in Frontierland. We did the bobsleds in the venting and the lights were fantastic.Lots of stuff to buy. Food is better than I remember 5 years ago as more choices than just deep fried available.Good walking shoes and determination to complete most things are a must! We have a 2 day park hopper and will be back again tomorrow. It’s great going between the two parks with California adventure and also downtown Disney. Yep still great even after all these years.',\n",
       " 'I have visited Disney for 20 years. great times . great memories. Over the last 5 years the park has become more crowded or less staffed. The rides are not kept up like they used to be or they are used harder . Disney used to be pristine. from rides to hedges to sparking restrooms. This is not the case any longer. It seems that good enough is the new standard. Having major attractions closed for renovations is part of the maintenance. Having 3 of your 6 major rides down seems like i am being ripped off. The food is 3 out of 10. the price is 400% out side in the real world. if you are going to charge me. that rate have the decency to make it taste like someone actually tried it before you tried to sell it. Bottom line is - you will go because you are forced by tradition - you will miss the good old days when there was pride taken in doing an exceptional job and a desire to provide you a magical day. my advice pack a lunch and a few snacks. Follow up a year later. Same issues only worse. Bathroom cleaning was just horrible. Gross as can be. The grounds were dirty and unkept. Buzz light year ride smelled so bad i was embarrassed I had my kids there. Food is still un worthy of any cost . Got stuck on space mountain snd thunder mountain. Go to universal Studios- they seem to be on the rise',\n",

It was the happiest experience from the security cues (well done), Christmas decorations and lights, the Christmas Parade and the lights at night with fireworks. And the speciality Disney foods...everything was perfect. Even a big kid over fifty has been left with lifetime memories. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Golden Horseshoe has the Corn dogs to die for, but they serve theirs with fries. The other locations have apples or chips for the same price.

       " \"Spent 3 days at Disneyland this year. Jan 14 to 17 th. They offered 20% off ticket price as it was low season and some major attractions were down.(Splash mountain, Haunted mansion, California screamin, Grizzly run, Mickey Ferris wheel). This was fine to me as we knew this before we bought our tickets. Once at the park the lines were 60 to 90 minutes wait as well as space mountain breaking down. Soaring over the world breaking down as well as Radiators springs Racers breaking down.What did I pay for exactly??? Indiana Jones and Pirates of Caribbean? Well Indiana Jones ride the Boulder didn't work and the time before that we sat in the dark for about 2 minutes before ride started moving again. Disneyland has been my favorite place to go for very many years but no more. Walt Disney would roll over in his grave if he could see what has become of this park.On a positive note knotts Berry farm for one day was cheaper and you get your fair share of rides I without the ridiculous wait time.\",\n",
       " 'Disneyland was much better experience than California Adventure was with our little boy (2.5 year old - less than three year old so he gets in free). But still due to the big crowds and queues on a weekday mid January it is not worth it. Also for us it is a mystery that many of the rides are closed off season. Disappointing. But people love Disney and you will I guess always get overcrowded and thereby the ticket price. For the small ones I must recommend LEGOLAND. It was the best experience with no crowds and a lot of rides suitable for those below 3. And has a lot of playgrounds that disney don’t have in their concept. Bad organization from Disney side as you need, even with the fast pass system, to spend most of the time waiting even on a weekday in mid January. But if you want to make your little one a little bit happy with some Disney flair then choose Disneyland over California Adventure and consider going to LEGOLAND.',\n",
       " \"Me and my husband have been at Dinsey World for Holidays and were prepared for the crowd, but believe me that in Disneyland there are much less people! The attractions lines at Disney World are 200-300 minutes! Disneyland gets pretty crowded, but it doesn't compare to Magic Kingdom.My advice if you want to go in New Year eve are:1.Fireworks: At Disneyland there are two schedules, one at 9 pm and at 11:50 pm. I recommend you see the 9 pm and look for a place to see them 2 hours before and then go to see the countdown in California Adventure, overthere you can have a beer, is less crowded and there is more space to walk. This way you can see the two New Year's special shows without so much stress.2. To make Fantasyland in 15 minutes: Disneyland closes at 2 am, so you can enter at 1:00 pm and do all Fantasyland because there are not many children.3. Buy the Max Pass! You won't regret it! This allows you to acquire fast pass without having to go to the attraction. In New Year if you find! You can also have all your photos of photo pass and have beautiful memories.4. Don't be afraid to change the park as often as you want! Take advantage of being in front of each other and help you not feel stressed and trapped.Good luck!\",\n",
       " 'Well I think Disneyland never disappoints this was my third time and so just love the place and would highly recommend going at Christmas time as the decorations are spectacular as are the fireworks nightly. Lots of variety for food and drinks and for first timers would recommend at least 3 to 5 days if you want to see both parks and everything. Get the Disney App as it is wait times on rides and is very helpful and just enjoy the best place on earth!',\n",

Just make sure to research before you go!! A lot of bad reviews are for ride closers and park closing early. May has grad nights where park closes early. Look at the Disney refurbishment schedules. This way you know what to expect.',\n",
       " \"Love Disneyland. Don't love the crowds or the ever raising prices. You have to go through security before you enter the park which is fine. I wish they had an express lane for people who aren't bringing the house with them into the park. Between strollers, purses and backpacks it takes 30 minutes just to get to the line to show your ticket and get into the park. Once inside it was very crowded, but we bought a $10.00 each fast pass. This allows you to get fast passes from your phone without having to physically going to each ride and waiting in line to put your ticket in to get a fast pass. Worth the extra cost. In reality you should be able to do this for free, but Disney is in it for the money, so we have to suck it up and pay for the privilege. Despite the crowds we really enjoyed our day. Finally tried the turkey legs that are so famous. It was pretty good, but so salty that it tasted more like smoked hamhocks then turkey. Couldn't finish it. The next time I go to Disneyland will be during off season so I can enjoy my day without getting ran over by strollers and motorized scooters.\",\n",

We figured the day after MLK would be ok,...um, no. 3 long lines before we even get into the park! Main Street and the front of the castle have ugly plywood, Mansion and Splah Mntn closed...no reduction in price, but increase in crowds. Perhaps a cap on local passes? The smaller size of Disneyland (compared to World) can\\'t handle the crowds at all. its obvious that the Disney \"corporates\" haven\\'t experienced \"The Happiest Place\" like the rest of us.',\n",

They should limit the amount of people or double the price of admission and try and limit crowds on special days. So people can enjoy a special day at a special place. Nothing feels special when you can't take a step anywhere without almost stepping on someone.On the day I went, things were so congested and miserable that some people were walking around with very poor attitudes. I witnessed 2 different insidents where fights almost erupted. Not a nice atmosphere for the kids.I'll be hard pressed to return.\",\n",

I know that people complain that rides are closed – but come on, they have to fix up and maintain the rides for safety and enjoyment. If you do your research you will know which rides will be closed for refurbishment before you go. Also if you go before or after Christmas/Halloween there are going to be rides closed to prep for the holidays – just keep that in mind when you plan. The park does a great job looking the part for the holidays. We had the 3 day hopper pass and were able to go back and forth between both parks. I highly recommend getting the MaxPass. It’s totally worth the price in my opinion. We got to ride so many rides and never waited in line longer than 30 minutes plus you get all your pictures. Is it a pricy place to visit? Yes. Is it worth it? Giant yes! I was really impressed with 95% of the cast members – there is always going to be 1 or 2 grumpy pants but overall they are super friendly and helpful and there is always someone around to answer your questions. The characters were awesome. I was blown away with how well they interacted with my daughter. They never come out of character and they drew out my shy little girl and got her to laugh and smile. She was in awe meeting the princesses and when I look at all the pictures the girls seem so genuine and real. I know it’s a job and they are actors but they do a darn good job of convincing me that they are the real deal! They spend a good amount of time with each kid too.',\n",
       " 'We visited the parks with our two grandchildren ages 5 & 2 on a day the rest of our family including their parents visited Universal Studios but were in great hands with Tommy. Tommy helped us celebrate our grandson’s special birthday going beyond all expectations including - a gift of personalized birthday ears, arranging for us to be the first family through the gates at ToonTown for birthday greetings by Mickey Mouse and a special interaction with an animated Crush from Finding Nemo, who sang him Happy Hatch Day -just a few highlights out of a wonderful day spent in the parks. Our normally timid grandson made fast friends with Tommy whose advice he trusted to take the plunge and ride Space Mountain and the Matterhorn! Tommy was equally in tune with our two year old ensuring she enjoyed attractions like Disney’s Jr. Dance Party and the Enchanted Tiki Room show, highlights for us all. In both cases almost no waiting. I don’t have a tally of the number of rides and attractions we covered but it was a lot. We couldn’t believe how we wizzed by and straight onto things while other families stood in long lines waiting up to 90 minutes for many many of the attractions we enjoyed. Tommy worked diligently on our behalf, helped by pushing one of our two strollers or holding our grandson’s hand, made our lunch reservation choosing a great spot (but refusing our invitation to join us), even guiding us on the best ice cream for each of the two children. Great value for the price and we should know having used the official Disney tour guide just two days previously with our larger group of 8. That was great but short of getting onto kiddie rides like Dumbo that don’t offer the fast pass option or arranging special seating and no wait tome for Fantasmic, World of Colour, the Frozen Show this tour is a fabulous option for a fraction (1/4) of the price! We can’t recommend using this tour company highly enough.

       " \"Disney doesn't get to not make improvements and have things closed down. There are so many other theme parks that do it better these days. Why do they get to charge what they do and not have to upgrade or enhance the individual rides. These are the same exact rides so themed differently. It's a cart ride through a storybook or a boat ride through a storybook. Why is this acceptable for what they charge? Long lines in the rides that are open and then other major rides like Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain are closed?? Sorry Disney, I will take Universal over this moving forward\",\n",
       " \"Buy tickets online in advance so you can walk up to the turnstile and avoid the lines to buy tickets at the park. Arriving to the park 30 minutes before it opens will enable you to walk into the park as soon as it opens and avoid long lines for the first couple of hours you are there. Get a fast pass right after entering the park for one of the busiest rides and then spend your time getting on other rides until your fast pass time comes up. The park gets busier and busier as the day goes on. Things slow down at night when everyone waits along the water/river area during the 9 pm Fantasia show. That is also a great time to go on rides. The Fantastia show is pretty good to watch. You can get a Fast pass for a better view in the roped off area. Disneyland is strict about not letting you stand to watch the show in areas that are not designated viewing areas. Use the train to get around the park The train stops by the Main Entrance, New Orleans, Toon Town, and Tomorrowland approximately every 5-8 minutes. You can catch the train from the main entrance to another part of the park without walking. It's especially useful after you are exhausted from walking around the park all day for getting back to the Main Entrance when your ready to leave. You can hop on the train right after the Fantastia water/light/firework show in New Orleans and get a ride to the Main Entrance/Exit. Schedule a reservation if you want to eat at the Blue Bayou. You can bring food and drinks into the park, just not in glass containers. Try to go during the off season, do research online before going to learn other tips for maximizing your time at the park.\",\n",

But that is the Disney spirit of change. Now Princess Leia and the Star Wars gang are moving into what had been the painted desert. Alway fun.We now enjoy just sitting in a restaurant patio and watching the crowds. Starbucks is is fairly recent addition. Change, nostalgia, and attempts to improve on the past.

       " 'We went to Disneyland last Friday Jan 12. No Splash Mountain, no Hunted Mansion and the gardens in the entrance and in front of the castle were covered with hideous jail-like plywood walls, so no fireworks or parades either. And, just to complete our worst experience ever, when it was our turn to ride the Space Mountain, they closed it at 9:45 (park closed at 12:00) \"due to technical problems\". We later heard a lot of people complaining that all other main attractions also \"suspiciously\" closed at the same time (they probably wanted everyone to leave already?). If the Company really needs to fix some attractions, then they should wait to fix their main gardens, so at least people can have a parade and fireworks. Our general impression in this whole matter was that the Company did not want to spend on parades, fireworks or even the electricity of the attractions, since most visitors were annual pass holders (which we were not).Another couple of comments: (1) Even though we are not pass holders, we have gone at least once a year for the past 12 years, and we have always found the same characters for encounters with the public. There are no longer surprises like in the 80\\'s or 90\\'s, where you could walk into Pinnochio, Captain Hook or a whole different character every time. (2) The employees seem distant (just like in any second-tier park) and are no longer friendly.All in all, the Magic is gone. Regretfully, Disneyland has become another dull \"amusement\" park. From \"the best\" to \"another one\".',\n",

Surprise - by midday it was packed, by late afternoon didn't even feel safe to be there and keep track of 4 kids. Without the Fastpass Program, we would have spent thousands of dollars to be there and would have accomplished very little. Getting there early, which we did, is a must as you can hopefully get in one lineup for a desired ride without using your Fastpass. Visually the sites are amazing, but on Day 2, you want to maximize your ride potential, which is almost impossible given the throngs of people and the long lineups. The parts of the Park we enjoyed the most were the parts that were most empty in the morning. We'd also bought a 3 Day Park Hopper Pass, but discovered the only way to get from one to the other was to go through the main gates again, so suffering lineup fatigue we didn't do that. We did have high hopes for the one Early Morning Magic Pass Day, but discovered that most of the rides the kids wanted to go on were not operational that early and they were grumpy from being woken up early. Also no fireworks, not sure if that's standard for January or because of the California fires, but it was disappointing. Yes we did have fun, and the kids were amazed, but as a destination when you invest a lot of time and a lot of money it was disappointing.\",\n",

       " 'Spent one day on a Wed. The park was busy, but since we planned our day, we got in all of our favorite rides and attractions in 30 minutes or less. We got Fast passes for rides such as Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Matterhorn Bobsleds, Space Mountain, etc. Since we had several adults in our party, we took turns getting the fast passes and while they went, the rest of us would go in smaller rides. We were happy to experience Disneyland with a group of 12 people. Our group had young children 5-10 yr. olds as well as teenagers and we enjoyed all the rides together. The only rides that we couldn’t ride with our 5 yr. old were Indiana Jones and Space Mountain because she is 44 “ inches tall and kids need to be at least 46” to ride it. All the other rides required a minimum of 42” inches. Star Wars is much improved since last I remember, included stuff from Rogue One, etc. We purchased tickets at Target.com with a 5% discount, but also found out that if you live in Southern California, sometimes there is special offers . Also, we saved money by bringing our own snacks. As long as you don’t have any glass containers, you can bring anything into the park that you can carry in your stroller and/or backpacks.',\n",

Fast pass is essential as lines really are a pest. Minimum wait time 20 mins but could be 90 minutes for some.Highlights are: Matterhorn bobsled, Star Wars, tea cups, it’s a small world, Indiana Jones, pirates of the Caribbean, Alice in wonderland ride. Everything was fabulous. Even the huge turkey legs were great.',\n",

Rode both Jungle Cruise, and Pirates then reserved next FastPass while exiting ride. Rode Thunder on way over Space and Reserved Third pass. (Matterhorn) did Buzz and Small World. Even though park was busy we were able to stay a step ahead of crowd. Fastpasses guardians and had lunch while waiting for ride. Fastpasses Soaring and did Racers single rider. Fastpasses Buzz while inside soaring. By 3 we were ready for break so watched Frozen. Fastpassed Star Tours while watching play. Went to Hotel to swim and fastpassed Big Thunder from hotel. Went back to park for Star Tours Thunder, Fantasmic...then over to World of color to end the day. 25,000 fit bit steps...but never stood in lines even though some standby were up to 2 hours long.

       " \"I've been a season pass holder for several years. I visit the park with my young daughters regularly. This will be our final year as season pass holders. Last night, Friday, January 12, 2018, Disneyland had many attractions closed. Walking around the park, several areas had 7' pieces of plywood blocking areas such as just inside the main gates and the courtyard just outside the castle. Biggest problem is that Disneyland can't keep its rides running. Last nights, around 9:45PM, 4 major attractions were broken down at same time. As a regular visitor to the park, waiting long times in line only to learn that the ride suddenly broke down has become the NORM. We all left yesterday SOOOO DISAPPOINTED at the no longer Happiest Place on Earth.\",\n",

We purchased our tickets on Disney Parks website and wish there was a listing of the events when we chose dates. Park food is costly and really is not that great. Glad we brought in water and snacks in a backpack. I really appreciated the security check going into the park. Unfortunately, most people aren't prepared so getting through takes substantial time so arrive extra early to get through security. Castmembers are not as cheery and friendly as in years past. Sucks that Disney Parks are not supporting their employees like they use to and it is showing.\",\n",

The next two days were very crowded even though it was supposed to be the off season. I know Disney wants/needs to bring in maximum revenue but how great would it be if the put a cap on the number of people allowed in. It was just a sea of people trying to move around, not that this is going to keep us away, but it might improve everyone’s experience. Still a fantastic time !',\n",
       " \"I'll have to say that I spend most of my time in the park comparing it to Disneyworld, which if FAR superior. From the attention to detail to crowd management, to pretty much every aspect of the experience, Disneyland is just a bit 2nd rate in comparison. Don't get me wrong; you'll have a wonderful time, but it's just not THE quintessential happy place any more. I was surprised by how small the castle is. Otherwise the attractions are pretty much the same. I was there a a very unfortunate timing (SEPT) when they were transforming a lot of the rides for the Halloween theming. So didn't get to experience some of my favorite rides (eg, haunted mansion). Definitely need to go and check that off your bucket list, but realize it is smaller, more crowded, and perhaps a bit less happy than its Orlando counterpart(s).\",\n",

Nothing worse than being stuck in line for 1+ hours and have the ride take 30 seconds. Apart from the opening street, there is very little atmosphere in the park. There was no music playing when walking between rides. Many of the rides were broken on one of the mornings we were there, but by mid afternoon they were all working again.Make sure you take advantage of all the fast passes available as they allow you to skip the line when it is your time. Also if the ride allows single rider option take that as well. There were multiple rides where the line was 1+ hours and we only had to wait 10 minutes in single rider line.',\n",

This was our first time using the lockers and wow was that helpful. We brought some long sleeve shirts/jackets to wear at night and paying $7 to not have to carry them around all day was the best $7 I spent at the park. There is a Star Wars movie next to Hyperspace Mountain, that was good only because it gave us a chance to sit down. Surprisingly disappointing - I get that Honey I Shrunk The Kids is an old reference now, but at least it was a quality show. My only other complaint is that there were a surprising number of breakdowns of the rides. It took us three times to ride Indiana Jones as we\\'d wait in line and then they shut it down. (The first time we were literally the next people to board the car.) We had to beg the kids to give it the third try, they just said \\'That ride is broken, it never works.\" (They LOVED it once we actually got to ride it of course.) Space Mountain, the Haunted Mansion and a couple of rides at California Adventure also broke down while we were waiting, though not all of them for long. I\\'ve never seen that many in one trip before, it was very strange and I hope just a bad day and not signs that Disney is slipping. Complaints aside, obviously I\\'m a big fan of the magic (all of the staff we talked to were wonderful) and we had a great trip overall. I was disappointed because I knew what could have been, but the kids (first timers) hopefully won\\'t remember any of that.',\n",

Even though it's an iconic vacation destination, we found the overall cost of the Disney experience to be VERY high. From the entry fee to the food and beverages and souvenirs inside the park, be prepared to spend a lot of money (even more if you have small children that insist on lots of toys, balloons, snacks, etc.) The high cost of the experience spills outside of the borders of the parks as well and affects nearby lodging and restaurants. Lots of fun, but financially stressful.\",\n",

Fast pass a ride if you can and enjoy another while you wait for your time to return. Easy to get.

They are constantly warning you not to sit on the railings and they seem to design the railings specifically to make you uncomfortable (the ones on the Finding Nemo ride have little pointy \"waves\" on them so you absolutely can\\'t sit on them). Someone should mention to them that Legoland provides areas for kids to play while parents wait in line; and Universal has water fountains in their lines (at least in Florida).On our last visit, so many attractions were closed (are they ever going to finish with Tom Sawyer\\'s island??) and there were also impromptu closures like the Space coaster.I love the classic rides (Peter Pan, Pirates, Haunted Mansion) but I do wish that Disney could make the experience of getting into the rides more magical.',\n",
       " \"After many visits to WDW, we thought we'd try Disneyland. It's smaller and more manageable than WDW, but what a difference in attitude! Disney World is magical and immersive. Disneyland seems to be staffed with a bunch of lackadaisical Californians who just see it as there job. We also encountered a lot of line cutting. One person waits in line and then 10 family members join right before the character meet and greet. This isn't tolerated at WDW and people are asked to go to the back of the line. On our day at California Adventure, we bought our daughter Minnie ears. We left them tucked in the stroller so she could ride Midway Mania and someone stole them. I've never had anything stolen at a Disney Park. Luckily, when I explained what happened to the nearest shop they replaced them for free. Our baby wipes were also stolen at the same time. Who steals baby wipes?!?The Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique was its own mess as our appointment started 45 minutes late, but once it finally got started everything went smoothly. I highly recommend the highest package because your child will get the skip to the front of the princess line (through the staff entrance) and meet all the princesses after she's become one herself. It was wonderful!Overall, the best I can say about our experience is that the weather was great. The classic rides were also fun. Once you get past the less than magical Disneyland vs Disney World experience and accept DL for the more simple experience it is, it's fine. But now that I've visited both within a year, I'm just more of a Disney World person. I'll take a scheduled fastpass that I can schedule on my phone any day compared to waiting in line for almost everything.\",\n",

BUT: It is ridiculously overcrowded and the fast pass system nowhere near as effective as the one at Universal Studios. If you haven't dreamed of going the wonderful world of Disney for years, if you can get over queuing min 20 minutes (even with a fast pass) for a ride and over 60 for those rides without (you can only hold one fast pass at a time), can manage with at least two major rides broken down on the only day you'll ever go - then I'm sure you will love it. For us, we could appreciate the time, creativity and artistry that's gone in to the place - but it's basically a very beautiful and overcrowded human zoo or maybe cattle yard. Did not live up to the dream. Incredible what a brand makes people prepared to accept.

There were several rides that broke down while we waited in line which was very disappointing and several more that were being \"revamped\" (but you can google rides out of commission before you go - so at least you know what will be closed) Lots to see and if you really want to enjoy it - give yourselves more than one day - the 3 day pass will give you plenty of time to see it all and double up on some rides that you really liked. BUT, it\\'s Disneyland \"the happiest place on earth\" right...and for some reason buying a $10.00 balloon or paying $5.00 for a corn on the cob seems pretty trivial compared to that smile on your little one\\'s face! Your bags will get searched when you enter - so again be patient -safety first...Oh and don\\'t forget to rent a stroller - lots and lots of walking... we took turns pushing children and adults (not sure that was allowed)...

I was originally going to get 3 Day, But it was not much more to get the additional day at the time of booking, and I am glad I did. The one thing about small children is they find it hard to do a full day.Our kids were just the right age. They loved everything about Disneyland. They loved the characters, and got their photos taken with many.We travelled to LA just after Easter (arriving Easter Monday) and the park was still very busy, although many of the workers said it was quiet. We found it quieter the next week.Tips(1) get a 4 Day pass instead of the 3 Day. You can upgrade once there, but it costs more;(2) some food outlets are better than others. Some were really delicious. We found the worst to be the Red Rose Taverne (Part of the Beauty and the Beast section);(3) Fast passes go quickly for the more popular rides. Radiator Springs (in Cars) ran out by lunch time;(4) While the Fact passes are probably linked to an entry card, no one checked. So if there are four of you visiting, you can get four passes. And one person (here the 8 year old) can use them all;(5) Some rides have a line for a single rider, which was good as really only our 8 year old wanted to do many of the rides;(6) Photo pass is great, but we realised too late. If you get a card from the first person to take your photographs, you can link that to the App and they have all photos taken in the park linked. Also many rides take photos. At the exit note the photo code and likewise link it on the App. Then for one fee, you can download all of the photos taken in the Park;\",\n",

Where else do you see people of all kinds, from cute little kids to gaggles of tourists to big tatted up dudes who would seem scary in a dark alley, all grinning like idiots and having a great time? Whether I go on a ride or not, I just like soaking up the happy atmosphere. It can get overcrowded at peak times, and I really recommend avoiding it then unless you are a diehard fan. But the rest of the time it is so fun! Morning and late at night are the best times if you want to avoid crowds.

We were able to use fast pass to get on enough rides to not have to wait long. Walking around the park itself seemed cramped which is why I said it was crowded. All in all it was still a lot of fun.I have been to Disney World Magic Kingdom many times and found Disneyland to be almost exactly the same. Disney World is a little more spread out. A few of the attractions were different. I was with a 9 year old and an 11 year old. They both seemed to enjoy the park and felt it was on par with Magic Kingdom. Space mountain was a little different than the ride in Florida and in Florida there are 2 Dumbo rides but for the most part the parks are almost exactly the same...without the heat in Orlando.Fantasyland seemed a little more cozy in Disneyland and had a few more rides for little ones.The food options at Magic Kingdom are better. We ended up eating dinner at Downtown Disney which had plenty of options. The area is also a short walk from both parks in the area. The fact that both Disneyland and California Adventure were both 100 yards apart would have made things easy if we planned on going to both. One problem we did have was the Fantasyland section basically shut down at 8:30 or 9 pm for a fireworks show. Getting to the surrounding areas was very difficult at that time.We did have a great time and would come back again if ever in the area again!',\n",

We had 3 day park hopper tickers, and the convenience of being able to go between the two parks is why we choose park hopper tickets.

The lines for rides were not too bad, fast pass saved us tons of time, and after 8pm it seemed like almost no lines or wait at most places! Hyperspace mountain is way more turbulent than space mountain in Florida, I got motion sick on it....It got cold at night in april so we needed a jacket or sweatshirt, hot in daytime under the sun, take lots of sunblock, water and hats! They let you take in a few food items like small snacks, granola bars, water, and you can refill water bottles at the water fountains...they don't have any adult beverages at the park BTW but you can leave to go to downtown disney which is connected to the entrance of the park and reenter the park; water bottles at disneyland cost $3.50 in case you forget to take yours! mickey shaped pretzels were very good as was the mickey shaped ice cream bar!\",\n",

Be flexible, pack your patience, and enjoy.\",\n",

First the good stuff, I like that the fast pass system hasn't changed to the Disneyworld system (which sucks). Some cool updates to old rides like Hyper Space Mtn. And the Tiki room is still the same as always, same with PoC. The down side... lots or rides breaking, and a lot already closed for renovation (how do you plan to have so much closed during spring break... dumb move). The food seems to have gone down hill since the last time, and the response from customer service isn't at all what it used to be. Over all, it was still fun, just not the disney experience I have come to expect. Probably won't bother trying it again to be honest, just not worth the lines and aggravation at that price.\",\n",

Another testament to it\\'s popularity!\\xa0 I\\'ve actually seen this attraction at the Grand California Adventure Theme Park and \"it never drew the crowds that were present this evening!\"As my pictures depict, it was about as crowded as \"the Los Angeles freeway @ peak commute hours!\"\\xa0 There was liberally nowhere to sit!\\xa0 It was standing room only and about 4-5 does deep with spectators!The light show didn\\'t disappoint and started at 8:30PM but didn\\'t reach our end for another 20 minutes!

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Disneyland. I usually don't like rides but there were plenty of rides for me to enjoy. My teenage daughter also enjoyed the rides although the Disneyland rides are, in general, not as adventurous as those in California Adventure Park. We also enjoyed watching the Parade and and the Electrical Parade (at which we had reserved seating as part of the Blue Bayou dinner package). Unfortunately we missed out on the Fireworks as they were cancelled 5 minutes before they were due to begin on the night we went to watch them. There are also a variety of food options from hot dogs and burgers to restaurants and although prices are reasonably expensive we expected this, after all we were on holidays. Lines to some of the rides are quite long but the fast pass system gives everyone (not just those who can afford it) the opportunity to choose a couple of rides each day to not have to queue for. (We also took advantage of the single rider lines where possible). All-in-all we had a great time at the happiest place on earth!\",\n",

       " \"We have been to Disney World in Orlando many times and still found Disneyland very enjoyable. The last time I had been at Disneyland they still used the lettered tickets - so let's just say it had been awhile. The staff is exceptional, we were able to get food quickly and lines were manageable. Being spring break the park was VERY crowded (even on a Tuesday) - so navigating our way through the park felt very congested. We spent one day here and found that to be a good amount of time. We probably could have used another half day. With that said, I also pre-plan our Disney days by visiting Disney's website prior to our trip to make a wish list of the shows and attractions we want to see and do. Once in the park we grab a map and highlight (bring one with you to the park) the numbers of the attractions we want to be sure to include in our day. This saves a lot of time chasing around the park and wondering if you forgot something. As other reviewers suggest - you have to maximize the Fast Pass program. The one ride that I wish that they had a FP for and don't is Peter Pan. It's always a long wait. After the 10:30 fireworks we were able to get on it (waited 35 minutes). If you also like this ride I would recommend going on it first thing (after getting your map and for first FP tickets) or during the afternoon parade. Note that a number of rides in Fantasyland close (temporarily) during the electric light parade and open after the last fireworks. I also found that the Disney app (see their website for the specific one) was very helpful when looking for characters, ride wait times, finding bathrooms, looking at menus etc. - and it's free. We'll go back some day - loved it!\",\n",
       " \"Leave your worries at the gate and just soak this experience in. It's always clean, it always smells good (even when it's packed), everyone is super nice (unless it's time for the parade and you get a couple of cranky employees) and the food is pretty darn good! Here are my tips: go before it opens and wait in line to get in. It really starts to get busy a couple hours after the park opens. Whichever ride is your favorite go to that one first. If you can book at a Disney hotel that offers magic hour ( you get in an hour early) and go early for that. It's makes a huge difference in knocking some of the rides out fast. Side note on that- if you do a hotel with magic hour plan to book around that because it's scheduled days and you don't want to miss out on that! If you want to see the parade find a seat a couple hours early. Take turns watching the spot you pick. It's a great time to do a little shopping. If the parade isn't important, hit those rides. The lines shortens during that time. Fast pass is the best friend you didn't know you had...use it. Dole whip, go inside where the tiki room is the line is tiny. I never understand why people wait so long on the outer line. Plus the tiki show, if you decide to watch it, is a great place to enjoy that dole whip in a shaded and air conditionied place and bonus it's a pretty cute show. Most places will give you complimentary water with ice. It's expensive, it's crowded, the lines can be super long but it's worth it.\",\n",

Star tours, space mountain, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean were the most beautiful and impressive ones.',\n",
       " 'My boyfriend and I love Disneyland! We went along with a larger group of eight, which included a nine year old and a twelve year old. The magic was alive in all of us!Some helpful tips and tricks...1) use and abuse those fast passes. They are free, you just have a limitation on how many you can have at any given time. But they can cut down a 120 minute wait time down to 20 minutes. Having one person in charge of all the tickets with the ability to run up ahead and gather fast passes and keep track of all the times. 2) Know what is going on in the area. For instance, Spring Break of the local schools, things being hosted at the nearby convention center. 3) If coming from out of town, go during the week days. The capacity of the park feels like half the amount of people from weekday to weekend. It changes the experiance completely. 4) If you want to do sit-down restaurants, MAKE RESERVATIONS! The wait time can be as long as some of the larger rides. Plan for everything. The park opens at 7am and closes at midnight. Snacks! Water! Bandaids! Light Jacket!',\n",
       " \"Great experience for the whole family. Recommend going at park opening and leaving at park closing. Avoid going back to back days it's very tiring.

When we went behind the scenes, the cast members were very rude to us, and to be honest, treated us like garbage. After we had finished our parade, (Which we technically paid disney for us to do in the form of park tickets) we had to walk from behind space mountain to the back of toon town, all while we were burning up in our thick uniforms in the spring heat. Meanwhile, about four empty trams passed by us going the same direction. The only thing we got from being free entertainment for Disney was a super cheap generic Chinese-made 3¢ cinch bag. Keep in mind that we paid Disney to entertain their guests, which they, in return, gave us some cheap disney branded crap and 4 miles of walking in our uniforms.',\n",

Several major attractions were closed for maintenance while several others shut down periodically for whatever reason. We didn\\'t get to go on the Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Riverboat, Captain Hook\\'s ship, and others I can\\'t think of at the moment. The Indiana Jones ride broke down several times during our visit and we were turned away on those occasions. It took us four days to even get to see Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln as it was often closed for some reason.The crowds were unbelievable, even though this was \"supposed\" to be a quiet off-season time at the park. They had something called Annual Passholder days and that may have contributed to the crowds. A local guest said it was as bad as any busy summer day.Overall, we didn\\'t enjoy our visit and that\\'s a sad commentary. If you look at my avatar you will notice it is a Disney castle. We are big Disney fans and always enjoy Disney World. We were very disappointed with our five days out at Disneyland and the California Adventure.

This last time I went on a Monday thinking it was going to be pretty empty, I forgot it was the beginning of spring break. It was 8:30 AM and the place was packed already. To my surprise now you have to pass a security check at the parking lot as if you were in an airport. Rude employees, huge lines, stupid rules. Tickets are now horribly expensive, for a family of four expect to pay near 700 just to get in. I spent almost 100 at lunch for the worst hamburgers I have had in a long time, many of the main attractions were closed, one hour lines for each ride, they just don't have a limit on how many people they can handle, rude employees, really think twice about going, it is probably the worst and most expensive vacation I have had in a long time.\",\n",

The whole park is beautiful and landscaped amazingly well. We have 2 boys with Autism. I can't stress enough how amazing Disney was for our boys. They have a program that helps eliminate long wait times in line and allows you to plan your days easily. I would highly recommend checking out less busy times if crowds make you anxious.\",\n",

But Disney land does not offer alcohol like California adventure and downtown Disney do\",\n",
       " 'There is not a whole lot that Disney can do if there are simply too many people, but one thing would be to allow more fast passes. We also visited Walt Disney World and they allow 3 fast passes a day and you can schedule all of them in advance and even on-line and with the app if you have a Disney account (free). Disneyland needs to do something like this. Notwithstanding, we still (as So Cal residents) enjoy making the occasional visit. We love celebrating our anniversary at the Blue Bayou restaurant and have done so 15 or so times. One suggestion: if you want to eat at the Blue Bayou, make your reservations in advance, either on-line on your Disney account or by phone. While they take walk-ins (which we have done a number of times), reservations are best and should be done as much in advance as possible. Understand that a credit card is needed and that if you do not show up, you will be charged $10/person, so plan well. Another suggestion is to arrive at the park early and go to Star Tours first to pick up your fast pass (as that is one of the longer lines) and then go ride other rides and come back. The best times to go are midweek (Mon-Thur) and not during high season. One way to check is to go the the Disney site and look at the blackout days for the various passes. The blackout days tend to be the busier ones, so if a day is blacked out for the passes, I would suggest NOT to pick that day to buy a ticket. Eat a hearty breakfast before you go and share meals in the park to save money.',\n",

The park has changed a lot by adding a lot of Star Wars attractions since I'd last been. There are a couple apps out there to help you really navigate rides and attractions too. Make sure and ride the classic rides as well. Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. still a really good time to be had in the park at any age.\",\n",
       " \"We visited Disneyland and Disney Adventure Park using a 3 day multi park pass (only one park per day but personally I think you'd be crazy to try to do both in one day). We did 2 days at Disneyland and one at Disney Adventure Park. Sunday was much quieter than Monday and Tuesday.Over 3 days in the parks we walked over 55KM so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. For speed and to avoid the interminable queuing get in to the park as soon as you can and dash for a fast pass to one of the big ticket attractions: Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Star Tours or Hyperspace Mountain for instance. Simply present to the ride within the allocated time window and you'll skip most of the queue. Note on your fast pass when you can next get another fast pass. This way you can always have two or three on the go at once. Whilst waiting for the fast pass try some of the other rides which are great too but may not have such crazy queues. Fantasy land is quietest early in the day (even on the busiest day we waited no time for it's a small world, Pinocchio, Mr Toad etc) but gets busier later. There is no fast pass system for Pirates of the Caribbean or Peter Pan, both must do rides, the advantage of no fast passes for these rides is that the queue is genuine and ticks along nicely. For the parades secure your curb side seat early or enjoy a long stand!Food and drink is incredibly expensive ($4.50 for one Churro). We bought tortilla crisps, water and sandwiches at the local CVS pharmacy before entering the park and this helped keep costs down a bit.A little organisation is required to make the most of your visit, spontaneity is definitely over-rated - Enjoy!\",\n",

Magic Mornings aren't so magical because getting up at 6am to get ready to get kids fed and dressed for Magic Mornings really doesn't make for a relaxing vacation as you're running from ride to ride before the rush enters the park.\",\n",

While I do prefer the Florida parks, this one has a charm the Florida ones don't. I liked seeing the characters walk around as if they live there. I loved New Orleans Square, there are a bunch of small things I love about this park that the other location doesn't have, however, there are a few things that just don't make me feel the same love for it. The cast members didn't seem as nice or welcoming as the ones in Florida. The Confectionary doesn't have as many options as Floridas and it's not maintained as well. I did love Disneyland, and some of the attractions are way better here, Its a Small World is the perfect example. If you've never been to the original park you should go at least once, it is very charming and sweet.\",\n",
       " 'Since I have been to DL so many times, I figured I would leave a quick review with some tips for first-time visitors.Disneyland is expensive and crowded. There- I said it. If you can get past those two things, you will have a great time! Over the years I have come to accept that if Disneyland was any cheaper, it would be even MORE crowded, so I suggest treating your trip here as just that- a \"treat\". Know going in that you will spend more money than you are comfortable with, but hey, it\\'s a (potentially) once in a life time experience for a lot of folks. Here are some tips for folks that may help make your day less stressful:- Bring sun screen! It can get hot in So Cal, and if you are like me, it doesn\\'t take much to get burnt to a crisp.- Bring Water/Snacks. As of the last time I went to DL, water and snacks were allowed. Definitely get some food and drinks in the park itself, but make sure you have some supplies on you just in case.- Stop at town hall on the left hand side of the park after you go through the tunnel. They will give you a pin if it is your first visit, birthday, getting married, etc. Make sure you get there early as they run out of pins. When cast members see your pin, they will say something nice to you!- Get there early, and plan on staying late. If you get there just as the park opens, or slightly before, you can easily get on some of the longer-line rides. Take this opportunity to hit up Space Mountain, Star Tours, or Indiana Jones. -Manage your fastpasses! Get one when you enter, and try to be strategic with which ones you get and when you get them. The less you have to walk, the better, so plan out where you want to go, and at what time.- Consider dining at the Blue Bayou. I have gotten reservations the day of, and I think we were lucky to get them. Call ahead to reserve seating, and keep in mind that the restaurant is semi-fine dining, and IMO not a great place to bring small children (unless they are well behaved).-Main street is open for an hours or so after the posted closing time, so you can wait until you leave the park to pick up souvenirs and treats.Enjoy your time and take lots of photos- every trip for me has had some of that trademark Disney magic. Have fun!',\n",
       " \"My daughter and I had a couple of days in Anaheim at the end of a 2 week trip to LA, and considering we went to Tokyo Disneyland only a couple of months ago, we had the luxury of skipping some of the rides in Disneyland that we had already been on and didn't need to go on again. So we opted for a 1 day park hopper. I realise that's the most expensive option, but I didn't want to spend another USD100 for us to have a 2nd day just for the sake of making it a more economic option.Even so, I really can't see how Disneyland can justify charging USD179 each (AUD255) to stand in huge lines waiting. Yes, I realise now it was spring break. But a theme park should be able to handle its busiest times, and I really don't think Disney can. Or is it that everyone just loves standing in lines and queuing for things? That was one thing that my daughter and I couldn't believe - the lines of people queuing for absolutely everything. Maybe queuing is something that Australians just don't like to do?Based on recommendations from friends, we made sure we were at the gate by 7.30ish, lining up with everyone else. As soon as the park opened, we went straight to California Adventure Park to get some rides in before heading over to Disneyland at 10.30am.We immediately got a Fast Pass for the Indiana Jones ride - glad we did, because it was still a 5-6 hour wait until we could use it. And when we did, we immediately got a 2nd FastPass. It's a bit deceiving by skipping what you think is the queue, when you hand in your FP. But there is still quite a long way to go after that point, and still lots of queuing to do. Despite this, it was our favourite ride.During the course of the day, we got FastPasses where we could, but otherwise didn't wait in lines any longer than 30 minutes. So that means that we missed out on some rides that we would have really liked to go on (like Pirates). We thought the crowds would die down towards the end of the night, but even at 11pm, the stand-by line for Indiana Jones was still over an hour.The food offerings were expensive - USD10.75 (AUD15) for a pack of caramel popcorn? Thanks but no thanks. If I went again, I would definitely take my own food.Comparing Disneyland to its counterpart in Tokyo, we would go back to Tokyo in a heartbeat - so much cleaner, more spacious, less crowded, much shorter lines.Overall, I was disappointed with the day, and won't bother coming back next time I'm in the US.\",\n",

       " \"We visited Disneyland on Thanksgiving which I think was probably one of the busiest days at the park. Since we don't celebrate this holiday in Australia I don't think we quite understood its significance. The park is open from early about 8am until midnight. It is has been one of my dreams to visit Disneyland ever since I was a child and watched the wonderful world on a Sunday night. Being a fan of theme parks I was excited to go to the original and it was the best. Granted it was quite expensive to get in nearly $300 for a two day pass, but it is extremely well run. The staff were excellent and so friendly, engaging with guests. The park was pristine there was no litter anywhere and if a parade had confetti it was cleaned up straight after. The food was reasonable in price and they had plenty of fountains to refill your water bottles. It was very crowded though I think that had a lot to do with the holiday and there was long lines to go on the most popular rides. The rides were worth the wait, unlike rides at Australian theme parks, they go for a long time and are the product of a lot of imagination. We went on Space Mountain, the Indiana Jones ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, two boat rides, one that went through miniature villages of Disney movies including Aladdin & Frozen and a jungle one that went past different animatronic animals. We also went on the famous teacups which was part of my childhood dream though the more you spin the faster they go which leads to dizziness! There are lots of people that go to Disneyland and it seems like many families make it part of the annual vacations, with families wearing matching shirts, with their names, well, Mum, Dad, Nanna, little brother and big sister etc on them. There were also a lot of people in wheelchairs and mobility scooters, that you can hire at the park. I'm not entirely convinced that all the people using these facilities were actually disabled as those with mobility issues get priority in the lines and take along their family of 10 people along, so it seemed to me that it was a sneaky way to not have to wait in the queues, which at times were over an hour wait. If you are staying at the Disney Resort there is a complimentary fast pass, that allows you to jump the queue for each ride, but if you want to go again are given a time at which to return, which is fair enough.We enjoyed the parade & waited nearly 3 hours for the fireworks over the castle which was then cancelled due to the wind, though it was not really that windy. That was most disappointing as our feet were sore after a big day walking around, and if we knew that there was going to be no fireworks we would have gone to either the laser show at the California Adventure park which is the sister park or gone back to our accommodation.We caught the ART bus there which was $5.50 per adult for 1 day, of $14 for 3 days. It was a good way to get around Anaheim and the drivers were excellent, the lady on our way there helped a lady in a wheelchair onto the bus, she was very professional.I was so happy to be able tick this off my bucket list and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting the wonderful world of Disney.\",\n",

They now have pictures beamed on the castle like it\\'s a screen so it\\'s cool.The old classic rides are still here and are fantastic, but the reliable \"fastpass\" system seems to have failed. When there are huge crowds, you have at least a one-hour wait in a standby line or you get the fastpass and have to return 7-8 hours later. In some cases, the passes were gone very quickly. The bad:I\\'ve visited this park many times, starting in 1979. I even had an annual pass one year back in 2000. Maybe it was because I went during spring break and it was overcrowded and thus, it was miserable. The rides had mostly 1-hour waits and there were so many people everywhere you went. Rides broke down daily, which just added to the misery. I would have to think very hard about visiting again anytime soon, and certainly not during spring break. Never, ever, ever, do this! You will be sorry! If you can figure out when it\\'s not so packed, then please tell the rest of us so we can enjoy this great park.',\n",
       " 'We went on rides and ate and got character signatures. We did so much, I was exhausted at the end of the day. The kids loved all the different rides, as did I. And we all got hats, some with mouse ears, some not; and t-shirts, and stuffed animals as take home mementos. There was so much to do, it was difficult to make a decision of what to do next. The youngest (7 and 10) enrolled in the JEDI TRAINING and part of that was dueling with DARTH VADER and other characters of the dark side. FUN FUN FUN!!',\n",
       " 'Nice place. Was spring break so was people all over. Had a lot of fun. But we get long lines. Good part you pay one ticket to see a lot of attractions. But i prefer orlando ones. Every park has their own magic. Negative part each park is a ticket',\n",

       " 'As always a great experience. From food to entertainment, top notch. But the crowd level really ruins the experience. Just too many people this week, was stressful and disappointing',\n",
       " 'Okay, so I was having second thoughts about going here. Thought \"why would I want to go to this childish style theme park\" my partner and I almost gave it a miss. For me, the rides were average, and are more experience rides rather than \\'thrill rides\\' Space mountain is overrated and fairly boring. Indiana Jones is the absolute best by far, pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted Mansion were awesome as well. For me, once being inside, it was little to do with the rides. More so the experience of being inside the original Disneyland. The smells as you\\'re walking through, the happiness everywhere, the attention to detail on the rides. I\\'m so glad I experienced this and it is a massive highlight and memory that has stuck with me. As a Australian, the Corndogs, Turkey Legs, Salted Mangoes, Sweets, Pineapple Juice w/ Ice Cream! It all won my heart. My future adventures will definitely be going to all of the second parks to check the thrill rides out in the adventure parks. Fantastic day.',\n",
       " 'Disney is a wonderful and magical place.. the fast pass system makes it easy to get in line at a certain time however it can be a LOT of back and forth and many steps in a day. Planning ahead is key and take your lunch, food, snacks, water. This would have been nice to know you still can bring these items in. At times the crowds are overwhelming and difficult to move around.',\n",
       " \"We are avid Disney World goers, having little bed in Florida for 15 years. We were excited to see Disneyland, but we're not sure if we would love it. We did!! We also loved that California Adventure Park and Downtown Disney were so easily in walking distance! It's hard to imagine if you are used to Disney World. It was fun to see how it was similar to and different from Disney World. We loved it!!\",\n",
       " 'Disney was great with all the usual rides and a few updates but parking was atrocious and way away from the entrances to Disneyland. Downtown Disney was fun and provided some reasonable more filling food options. Food in Disney and drinks were outrageous. Nevertheless a great family experience and you can take food and drinks in although they will search your backpacks!',\n",
       " \"We go to Disney a lot, once a year usually and we go to Disney world. We just went in October but we were in the Area so we figured we would scope out Disneyland.The first thing I notice is the staff is not near as nice or polished. Is this Really Disney I kept asking myself. The entrance to the park is forced through downtown Disney and a TSA like probe.....Entering the park does not seem magical at all, where is the music and the happy people? The attractions were nice and I appreciate the rides were different than Orlando even the rides with the same names had variations that make it worth the trip.The food seems much more expensive a slice of pizza for 8 bucks rather than the ability to purchase a whole pizza for 20 is insane. So smiles from the cast they all seem beat down and depressed.The park offers little shade and it's miserable walking around in the afternoon. The castle is so much smaller and there is a huge shortage or places to eat.I would never go back to Disney if Disneyland were their only park. I will continue to visit Disney World\",\n",
       " \"Disney is a great family park. We recommend arriving early because it can get super packed. We recommend buying your tickets on line and print them at home. It's a less line you have to do. They now have fast passes next to some attraction. Keep in mind not all the attractions have this. We recommend doing this to save time, it tells you what time you can just walk in the attraction without doing those long lines. When it comes to food don't forget to have the Dole Whip Float it's so good and refreshing. For lunch we recommend the Rancho del Zocalo restaurante. It's Mexican food at a very affordable price.  At night they have the Electrical parade , this is not a big deal. Its a bummer because they block all the mayor streets, so if you want to go to an attraction they make you do a big turn to get where you want. I must say this sucks if you are tired. So on this same note wear comfy shoes , trust me. The night show that we recommend not missing is the fireworks and world of color show. This is so beautiful. All in all this trip was very fun.\",\n",
       " \"Let's face it, this is The Happiest Place on Earth. With that said we had a fun time. We did bring our own snacks and water so that we wouldn't have to take the time to stop and eat. We spent 12 hours at both parks and got to ride numerous rides. Yes it was busy but the crowds were manageable and we all had a great time.\",\n",
       " \"We went during spring break and it was busy but never stood in line for more than 40 min. Disneyland is the master of lines keeping you entertained while making them look small.The three things you will NEED is the park hopper pass, Disneyland app and your phone with data. The app show closed attractions, washrooms, length of lines, fast pass times and where and when Characters can be found. Fast passes will ensure you do not spend your vacation standing in lines. We had our older son who would run ahead and get our fast pass then we would go to the other park and get a fast pass there. Then we would plan our rides based on lineup times until we could use our fast pass and get another. We did 5 days and only had a couple of rides we wanted to do on day 5 and spent allot of the day repeating our favorite ones. We rented strollers for the two little girl's 6 and under. This is a must because you cover a lot of ground in a day. We left all our stuff in the strollers and never had any issues until the last night when someone grabbed the wrong stroller after the fireworks. We got all our stuff back the next morning except 1 souvenir cup ( they throw out any containers that contain or possibly contain liquids). Disneyland did replace the cup free of charge which was fantastic. This trip can be expensive with the dollar exchange but is a must for families. My recommendation would be to take kids when they are between 6 an 10 as they can ride almost any ride and they really appreciated the magic of the park.\",\n",
       " \"Took my niece for her birthday. If you tell the person when you are buying the tickets they will give you a button and you can write your names and stuff on them. So they have buttons for like birthdays and weddings etc. We went on a day that it was supposed to rain all day. There wasn't a drop. It was crowded but I guess it wasn't as bad as normal. Works for me!\",\n",

They loved every ride that they were on, though we didn\\'t make it to all of the rides during our 2 days in the park. Our visit was during Spring Break season and it was often difficult to navigate through areas of the park due to the crowd size. We managed to snag a prime spot for the Electric Parade on our 2nd night and were thankful for the front row view.',\n",

       " \"Tickets ($124) are expensive considering you have to pay for anyone's over 3, in addition to $20.00 for parking. Would recommend Disney World in Florida any day over Disney land, for the monies you pay. Lines were way too long for popular rides (in mid-March) - waited a minimum of an hour each ride. Kids were getting pretty tired. Ended up covering only Magic Kingdom. Missed out on visiting Tomorrow Land, Frontier Land, and Adventure Land. Electric parade was A+++ - worth the wait (about two hours in advance for a good viewing area seating for the 8:30 parade).It's Small World was great. Peter Pan was not worth the wait.\",\n",

We were told that if she wears a button the employees will say happy birthday etc and make it special. This was not the case at all. None of them ever said Happy birthday. They were rude on the monorail as well as the Car rides. The one employee on Luginies ride made it special by having people in line sing happy birthday. Disney World the employees help make the experience wonderful and are so helpful.',\n",

That wasn't what disappointed me. We went on a Tuesday, at the beginning of March. It was not spring break time, yet it was very crowded. With how much the entry tickets are and the thousands of people that were there, I figured Disney could afford to have more of the Disney characters just walking around strictly for meet and greet/ pictures. One that we did see out and about was Mickey. We joined the line that had formed, but after about 5 minutes another employee walked up, stopped at the group in front of me, and then told me that the line ended at that group. There was my family and another family behind us - Don't know why they wouldn't stop the line after us two groups and stay there to alert anyone else from joining the line --- BEFORE they joined. They only had two Disney princess characters available during the time that said they would be there. The lines are deceiving! They make it look like the line is short, but hide half of the line in the props and what not so you can't see how long it actually is. Aside from the, my family still enjoyed our visit, there are just things that we learned and know what to do differently whenever we return.\",\n",

       " \"After many visits to Disney World we made our first trek to Southern California to take in Disneyland. The park is similar to Magic Kingdom in layout and design. The park is clean and safe and has plenty of Disney Magic. The castle is not the scale of Cinderella's castle at DW but it is an Icon itself being the first. If you're a Disney fan this is a must because this is the only park Walt himself had his hands on. There are numerous rides and shows but my favorite thing was near the entrance at the Lincoln building you can see the bench and a horse from the carousel that Walt sat on when he would take his kids and dreamed up the Disney resorts.

Then we heard it had already been down 2 times before. We had gotten Fast Passes to Indiana Jones ( everyone gets fast pass, another disappointment- because then what\\'s the point?!!), after we waited for our time ( which was 3 hours later) the ride was down!The crowds were ridiculous and it was total chaos!

Every time we find new places to eat and ways to make the day less stressful/exhausting. They hire perfect employees- I honestly never have interacted with any that weren't incredibly pleasant. Just walking up to the park fills me with happiness because the music they play. They've got nostalgia on lock down. Can't wait to go again and I'm 32. Not to mention, the character actors are GREAT!

       " \"Although I'm a lifelong Disney park fan, and there's still so much they do right, I couldn't help but feel Disneyland is going a little downhill in 2017. Many people, including hoteliers and cast members, agreed they have never seen the park this busy, and we haven't even hit peak times of the year. Add to the crowds the frequently broken major rides across both CA Adventure and Disneyland, and you have a bunch of disappointed people who want to love Disneyland.During my 5-day stay, Sat thru Wed, we saw all major rides down for hours on end except for Pirates, thank God. On our hottest day Wed, with temps approaching 80F, both Splash Mountain and Grizzly Rapids were down most of the day. We experienced many rides chronically open and close within a single day. On one day, every major ride with a few exceptions was closed for at least an hour.With construction for the Star Wars Land (Walt is cursing in his grave I'm sure), and huge crowds, crowd control was rough from sunset until closing, due to parades and fireworks. Although it's fantastic to have the Main St Electrical Parade back, the crazy crowd control patterns are nuts and extremely prohibitive. Somebody should be studying those to find a better way. A tunnel under the castle from Tomorrowland to Frontierland would solve many problems. The main men's bathroom in the bottom half of Adventureland was under construction, leaving huge lines in Frontierland. Overall, whoever is approving crowd control plans should be fired, and replaced with someone who understands the patterns, the need for bathrooms, and parade issues. It was painful.The groundskeepers are still top notch, and cast members are almost uniformly helpful and friendly, so there are still things to celebrate. But if Disney doesn't get on top of crowd control (e.g. Triple the local and annual prices), the luster could dim.\",\n",
       " \"Be there maybe as early as 6 am. Magic Morning isn't magic at all. Lines are crazy. Not all rides are open and no restaurant or food stall open early. Better bring your own food and water. Use fast pass for popular rides. Popular rides are open until 12 midnight. It is better to wait late at night for those rides.\",\n",
       " 'We did not know it was the beginning of Spring Break and only did One park. The wait times were decent on a weekend, but heard the crowds are coming during the week. The construction was quiet but virtually half of my favorites were closed. No Matterhorn, No train, No rivers of the Americas. No Bumblebee Lemon Cupcakes.....

I did my research and thought it would be a visit on par with WDW. For the most part, it was. The system of moving people effectively from parking lots to the park were the same. The through effort with a lost lunch at lost and found, was exactly the type of dedicated to details that I was expecting. Cast mates friendly and helpful as well. Physically going to the attraction for a fastpass was let down but we made that work. No fastpasses for meeting characters was disappointing especially with little kids. The one aspect I missed out on at WDW was purchasing a photopass, this time I made sure to buy ahead of time. Despite using the app we were only able to find photographers three times all day. We were there from 9:20 am til almost 8:00. Such a disappointment. Even had the girls hair done at Cinderella's boutique, no photographers. WDW had at least three stationed there in comparison.

Just step inside and see for yourself. I have loved Disney since my first visit as a child 30 years ago, but love it more today. I think, as one grows older and inherent childhood innocence is lost, one needs its magic even more. We have to be reminded to lighten up and just be happy! Disney does this more than any other organisation, ever.A day pass is around $100 plus food, beverages and souvenirs. Value-wise, it can not be beaten. The value it brings me is priceless.If I could afford it, I would have every holiday with Disney. I would go on a Disney cruise, stay in their resorts and spend every moment in their parks.

We spent 3 days here and every single day was horrible due to how crowded it was. We literally spent like an hour waiting for rides that were each less than 5 minutes long. I cannot understand why the Disney company would allow so many people to enter the park and let it become hell on earth. I cannot believe people put up with such bs from Disney with how pricey those entrance tickets are.I always heard that the park is always clean and bathrooms too. Nope, thats not accurate there was so many people that those bathrooms were pretty filthy.I cannot understand why the food which is of cheap quality would be so expensive. There is not many places where you can sit and rest. Also we tried watching the parade and fireworks but there was nowhere to go and see it. Many people take up all the good viewing spaces for the parade and fireworks a few hours prior to the show. So if you want to see it from a good place make sure you are there at 5pm. On our third and final day we had given up on this family vacation. We left early to our hotel and decided to just rest from all the horrible things that happened at Disney. Never again Disney.

The rides were very dated for most of the park and the workers weren't up to the level that they were at Disney World. California Adventure Park, on the other hand, was very well done and a good experience. Disneyland is very small and we were debating between going here and Universal Studios. In hindsight, we were probably better off going to Universal Studios in lieu of this but our curiosity got the better of us. There are simply too many people and not enough rides. The lines are ridiculous - which we expected - and there is a crazy amount of people there with small infants (many less than 4-6 months old) and toddlers with strollers in such a small space. Disneyland is definitely showing it's age - I would skip the park and go to California Adventure if you must go to the park.

On the plus side they brought back the Electric Parade. Haven\\'t seen that in years. The Frozen show was worth the wait. It was definitely a hoot for everyone young and old.

       " \"Had a decent time still as it is the magic of Disney but the crowds are becoming intolerable. Everything in the park runs seamlessly in terms of cleanliness and service except when it comes to crowds. We went on a Sunday and there were parts of the park where foot traffic came to a halt for extended periods of time. In the 8 hours we were there, I was hit by 3 strollers and 1 electric wheelchair! I don't know why Disney doesn't at least assign some if it's many staff to help manage crowd control and direction of traffic if they are going to jam the parks to the brim. We were only able to go on 5 rides even with Fast Passes, making each ride cost $44 each for two people. In the rides where Fast Passes were not available, we waited 40-110 minutes. We were not even allowed throw money at any of the restaurants because they were taking reservations only. While we saw that reservations could be made online the day before, there was nothing to indicate that they were required. When we were able to purchase food from the casual cafes, there was no place to sit. We took our tray to another area where we found half a bench. In addition some popular attractions such as the Matterhorn were closed. Really love the rides and charm that the park has to offer but it's becoming too straining on patience to come here. May just avoid the park altogether next time and only go to Downtown Disney. I'm sure if you planned your trip out on strategic days, reservations, and wait times, ran and pushed people when you could, you would be able to hit some type of agenda in the park even with the crowds. But it is just not worth it for us. It seems you need to be very determined and very well researched on park strategy to come here now.\",\n",

These rides are great and seeing the Princesses pink castle is a must do however if you have older kids who are thrill seekers then California Park is a better choice. This park is amazing but more suited to younger kids who want to witness the magical side of disneyland with all of the characters and the star dust and sparkles! You could do this park in 6 hours. California needs 8 - 10!',\n",
       " \"My wife and I visited Disneyland today. We tend to visit every few years but this will be the last visit until things change. It's always busy but today was impossibly busy likely due to Spring Break. But if this were any other business it would be shut down for being over occupancy numbers. This is a tragedy waiting to happen. There is literally no space to walk especially as ride lines become extended and further block available walking space. God forbid someone had an emergency or some major event happened.What I truly don't understand is why they be doing repairs on some rides if they know this is the busiest time of the year. Also, they claim to raise the prices in the busy season but I'm not at all convinced this is really done to reduce crowds. If they wanted to reduce crowds that would simply put quota on ticket sales and guests entering the park. Force people to make reservations (lottery if necessary) and reduce same day ticket sales/entries.The park was an overcrowded mess today. With rides closing down constantly (we had a stretch where we went to 4 rides consecutively with fast passes and each ride was closed down for repairs), lines weaving everywhere it was often very difficult to try to understand where the line actually started, long lines for food and bathrooms, etc. It was comically annoying and actually quite pathetic and I kept wondering why I had paid so much for this. It felt very overrated.Disney badly needs to stop thinking about only making money and actually try to think about providing a quality experience again and this will begin with crowd control. As far as I can tell they currently don't have any quotas or restraints on park entries and the fastpass system broke down today on multiple occasions. The park just couldn't handle the number of people within its boundaries and the most popular rides were pushed to their brink which ultimately led to many breakdowns. As for me, I will be spending my money elsewhere. This has become the tourist trap of all time tourist traps.\",\n",

Rides that I remember from when I was young but have closed at Disney World, like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and Snow White's Scary Adventures. And of course there are the new rides that are also great. The new Pirate's of the Caribbean opened on our last day and it was fantastic! My only negative is that Disney needs to invest some money into their older rides to make them more reliable. We spent a lot of wasted time in line. We would get to the front of the line where there were only a few parties waiting to get onto the ride in front of us and then the ride would close due to technical difficulties. This happened to us on Pinocchio, Haunted Mansion, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. We did get a pass to ride another ride when this happened on Haunted Mansion, or at least we thought we did, they load it onto one ticket from your party but when we went to use it the ride person said there was nothing on any of our tickets.\",\n",

Evacuation procedures are awful, needing more than a half hour to get people off a stopped ride. They don't advise about the closed rides before you buy a ticket, but that is part of the Disney culture: grab as much money as they can. There are lots of other people who will keep the lineups full. You need lots of patience and ways to entertain kids in hour-long lineups.\",\n",

It was so packed we could barely get food to eat, visit gift shops for souvenirs, and definitely couldn't do many rides. Wait times were 60+ minutes and fast passes were sold out till 6-8pm. I'm very sad and disappointed that Disney doesn't put some kind of cap on how many people can be in the park at one time. It definitely wasn't the happiest place on earth!\",\n",

Thank god for the extra time in the park Extra Magic Hours that came with staying in a Disney hotel. We did the majority of what we wanted to do between 7:00 & 9:00 am. Star Tours was great. Pirates was closed the day we were there, so we didn't get to see the revised ride. The Park is in really good shape. Disney is still magical.But the place shows its age in the narrowness of its walkways. By 10:00am, the place was packed, and it is overrun with strollers and scooters. We will not go again during any school holiday.\",\n",
       " \"We had fun, for sure. But with the train that runs the perimeter closed down we couldn't rest our legs and still get to some of the furthest places in the park. Plus last time we were there, Pirates was closed and now it was closed AGAIN! So we still haven't been on that ride. Plus the Matterhorn was also closed, so we didn't get to ride that past favorite roller coaster. But yes, we still had fun doing the things that we were able to do, even though the crowds were so big and the lines were so long! We got a fast pass for Indiana Jones, so that helped some, but it was still a long line. The revised Space Mountain - now called Hyper Space Mountain, was broken down most of the day, but got repaired in time for a late night ride (with a 20 minute delay due to another breakdown while we were in line). But it was fun once we got to it. By then it was late and we couldn't make it over to Splash Mountain without the train, so we missed that ride. It's still the happiest place on earth, but it could have been so much better if things were ALL working!\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I took our three-year-old son to Disneyland this week and for the most part we all had an amazing time (thank goodness we planned for afternoon naps back at the hotel every day… Best decision we ever made!) Of course, Disneyland is the classic institution of Southern California that is the realization of Walt Disney's dream. The castle still stands stalwart in the middle of the park and as a 50-year-old woman who grew up coming here over the course of my life I couldn't help but reflect about this place as it operates now in 2017. I think I hold a mental model of this park that comes from a little girl's brain from long ago. This week, what I saw was a small castle, an old park with narrow walkways that aren't capable anymore of handling the throngs of people that show up for the nighttime shows. The cast members do their best to control the crowds with their light lamps and ropes. They hustled us along like cattle at one point where we were ankle to ankle. No longer was I able to meander over to storybook land and peruse the shops because, when I went, storybook land was closed for the fireworks show and I was stuck with a stroller in a massive crowd of people that were being corralled down Main Street. I think that Disney has done its best with retrofitting parts of the park and keeping their classic rides current, clean, and updated. That being said, the crowd control is very problematic. Strollers are parked three deep all through tomorrow land and crowds are roped off so that one-way traffic can be encouraged all along the tomorrowland walkway. I can see how the company is trying to think innovatively about helping people navigate the park and I appreciate that. But with Star Wars land opening next year, I can't help but wonder how Disney will handle the influx of people, especially onto beautiful, but tiny little bottlenecked Main Street.One important thing that we learned was how to work the fast pass system. Without that, rides would have been very challenging to get on even in mid-March. We also had a four day park hopper which allowed us to use the magic morning hour. The magic morning allows you to enter the park one hour before opening. That was very nice as we were able to walk onto Buzz Light Year's Astro Blasters ride twice before the park opened. This meant a lot to my son. Finally, our experience with the Disney characters was spotty at best. Mickey Mouse on Main Street hurried us through the line and did no interaction with our son. It was definitely an assembly line. Disheartening, as he loves Mickey Mouse. It's interesting to see that the days of walking up to a character and getting a picture taken with them are long gone. Everywhere characters appeared lines of picture takers quickly formed. We even waited 25 minutes in line to get a picture with Darth Vader (Who, ironically, was very nice). :-)We also found a pattern of curtness with several of the cast members this trip. Many were still very helpful and sweet to our son though and I want to make sure to mention that. After these experiences, I can't help wonder, why?For me, some of the larger questions loom. How is this company building it's culture for its employees? What is their morale like? Why are the characters hesitant to dive in and interact? Why are they moving kids through the lines so quickly? There was something sad about that to me. Something that speaks of a very subtle loss of culture for this timeless and classic Los Angeles amusement park that has always been loved by so many.Surprisingly, it was a totally different vibe at California Disney. We got a fast pass for World of Color which we would highly recommend. The crowd control here was much better. We had plenty of room to stand in our assigned location. There are open eateries all through California Disney making lines short and food highly accessible. Plenty of seating areas and the rides were extremely well-run. The park was clean and the rides carried that beautiful imaginative Spirit of Disney but were much more modern and the way they were designed. The cast members of California Disney were consistently courteous, professional and friendly.Some of the pluses of our overall experience: Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain Railroad, Pirates of the Caribbean are all still running beautifully. My son loved them. Loved Buzz Light Year's Astro Blasters and, of course, Peter Pan. We love the fried chicken at the Plaza Inn on Main Street. As for California Disney, we would highly recommend the nighttime show world of color. The Ferris wheel is magnificent, and the redwood ropes course is great for little kids!With some careful planning, some strategic use of the fast pass system, and some expectations for some big crowds, you can still have a fantastic time at Disneyland, even in 2017.\",\n",
       " \"We went 3/13 - 3/16 & crowds were extreme. I thought it would be a little less crowded but I was wrong. We still managed to get in a lot of rides but I missed being able to ride much in Tomorrowland, only small world and buzz light year. Very sad that we didn't have the time or energy to stand in line for space mountain and Peter pan. We also missed autopia and star tours. Pirates opened last day of our stay and once the worked the bugs out, we were able to stand in a 45 minute line for the ride.\",\n",

With all the hype I half-expected gems and gold leaf or personal attendants to dust my shoes after each ride - alas, it's just an amusement park. If you've been to others this is probably nicer albeit more crowded. So many strollers, dodging them could be the most challenging event of the day. Food is good quality but higher in price than warranted. Healthy choices are always available, even for the kiddos. Be prepared for some rides to be closed for cleaning and refurbishment. Download the app for all the wait times at your fingertips. Take advantage of the FastPasses wherever you see them. If you have a full day to spend you'll have seen enough a second day isn't needed. If you have a second day for amusement, spend it at Universal, or skip Land and hit Adventure and Universal instead.\",\n",

Don't get me wrong, I love Disneyland and will return, but come on people, this is and has been for many years, one of the greatest family entertainment spots in the world.

The food items we purchased through the day were a lot better quality than I had been expecting (a lot better!)If you come to LA, Disneyland is a must visit place, at least once, with or without children- although I think children under the age of 6-7 would get overwhelmed pretty quickly.

       " 'We went on a Wednesday and by Disneyland\\'s pricing category, it was a \"Regular\" day (not a \"Peak\" day or a \"Value\") when crowds were suppose to be moderate. It was very crowded & the ride waiting times were very long. The best part of the entire day was seeing the Electrical Light Parade!!! I saw it a lot as a kid growing up in Southern California and it was just as great! People started saving places to sit and watch 2 hours before the parade started. About ½ before it started a nice employee found us a place along Main Street. Squeeze in behind the ropes with other people. They\\'re suppose to collapse strollers if they do not have a child in it to make room for people. FYI: the parade starts at Its A Small World and ends at the end of Main Street. We ate dinner at the Plaza Inn on Main Street. They have the best fried chicken dinner (3 pieces plus mashed potatoes & gravy, green beans and a biscuit) for $17.49. The kid\\'s plate is $6.99 for a small fried chicken leg, mashed potatoes & gravy, apple sauce and a small drink. Disneyland implemented going thru security right when you get off the parking structure\\'s escalators. It made it much more efficient and saved time having it there than by the ticket booths. TIP: You can bring in bottled water so you don\\'t have to buy it in the park. TIP: If you burn easily, bring sunscreen with you! We saw a lot of fair skinned people with red shoulders and arms from not protecting themselves from the sun. It was only 83\\' - warm, but not a hot So Cal day!',\n",

Food and souvenirs are overpriced however, I was pleased that there was even Pandora and Sephora in the park to my surprise. I think my major issue in this park were the standby lines for the attractions. Some approximate waiting lines were as long as 145 minutes, 2 hours and 25 minutes! I was not willing to wait that long. I understand that it was necessary to wait, but this seems to take more time out of family fun and you spend more time waiting than enjoying yourself.To my personal displeasure there was no clubhouse in Mickey's Toontown. What a let down! Would it be Mickey's Toontown without his clubhouse? No, it wouldn't. I think I'll skip out on disneyland for my next time in California, but it was nice for my family and I for the most part.\",\n",

About 50% of these high end attractions were either closed for maintenance or some other reason.Walking over to Disneyland California Experience proper found exactly the same issue. Because of this the queues for the functioning rides are that much longer. Despite it being the \"quiet season\\' queuing for an hour for a ride was par for the course.The highlight was the evening parade , which occurs just before the park closes. However you need to stand around for about 90 minutes before to ensure you can see it and don\\'t get moved on from where you are standing.We were on a ride that broke down eating up about 45 minutes once you include the queuing in the first place. We got given a ticket that let us shorten the queue time on a single other ride, Not really a sufficient recompense. We had bought tickets for two days being able to move between both parks. On the second day we had had enough and left about lunch time. I\\'ve been to Disney Orlando back in 2011 and it was a fantastic experience. In comparison Anaheim , both Disneyland and the California Experience, were a huge disappointment. It\\'s not the friendly experience that Orlando is either with most of the staff looking very bored.

According to a reliable source (aka close friend who stays in California with annual pass to Disneyland), there are only 2 places in the world where you can get Dole Whip. Hawaii and Disneyland Anaheim. Dole Whip is a soft serve made of Dole’s pineapple juice. It was REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD! We shall not do it any injustice by trying to describe it.

We have visited Disneyland almost every other year since we were children (and now have our own kids) and the service was always \"magical\", however, in this last visit, there seems to be an obvious change. Cast members were not as friendly or helpful. In fact at times, they were not friendly to the park goers... at lines for the rides, some cast members just wave people along without saying anything (not even a hello) or at the parade, cast members were yelling at guests to move (like, yelling in a rude manner). Maybe it was the heat?? We visited Disney World in Florida last year and the cast members there are still the authentic Disney-magic type who greet everyone with a smile and are helpful all around. Sad to see the original Disneyland may be losing its magic. Hopefully, this was a one off.

I have to say I was very disappointed with the experience. Everyone knows Disney isn't cheap but most people are ok paying because you know you're going to get a great experience, or so we thought. My first complaint would be the number of rides that were closed during our visit. Most people make plans for a trip to Disney months in advance but Disney will often release ride closures on very short notice. We knew about part of the park being closed while they work on Star Wars land and were ok with that. I assumed that meant that the other rides would be open. I was very disappointed to see just in the last couple weeks that in addition to the closures for Star Wars construction the Pirates of the Caribbean and Matterhorn Bobsleds would be closed as well. This was especially aggravating as these were the 2 rides that were different than Disney World that we wanted to experience. In addition to the ride closures we also experienced multiple unexpected temporary ride closures. We were in line 3 times where the ride broke down and they had to shut the rides down temporarily. Even the monorail was broken when we tried to ride that. The crowds were also a problem. We went during what was expected to be one of the slowest weeks of the year for the park and it was still quite crowded. Lines were often long for the attractions. I can't imagine coming here during peak season.Perhaps we were lucky on our previous trips to Disney World but we never experienced these problems before and again when you are paying Disney prices you expect a better quality. In the future we'll be sticking to the Florida parks.\",\n",

Park is just so cool we did every ride at least once! :)We had a 3 day hopper pass and we were very lucky with the weather as it rained and got a bit cold before and after those days.We were also very lucky that the big rides were all open when we were there... bit disappointed at the cheap star wars theme they gave to Space Mountain since I was last year.Magic morning was a major waste of time as so much of the park doesn't open until the normal time anyway, and the parts that are open become MUCH busier with other people having their magic morning.Thought it was crap how Downtown Disney was forced on everyone and we all had to hike through it every day to get to the Disneyland entry. Found the stroller parks to be a major eye sore and obstacle throughout Disneyland - they need a better solution.Lastly... we saw Donald at Disneyland near the main gate then went to California Adventure and saw him there too in a different outfit... and only 5 minutes had past! What are they thinking?! There can't be two Donalds out at once! There can only be ONE Donald!!!\",\n",

I am NOT blaming the weather on my day, nor will I blame Weather channel. And granted, it doesn\\'t rain at DL often. BUT!!! They need to step up their rainy day plan. Thunder mountain was closed, and there was no lightening. Autopia closed as we were being placed at a gate to ride. It was merely drizzling!! Buzz light year closed, and it\\'s an indoor ride! Also, more eating areas could be covered, not just for rainy days. On the upside, ponchos were available everywhere we went. Burgers from the place in tomorrowland were much better than expected. As usual, cast members always had a smile to make our rainy, soaked to the bone day, just a little more magical! And it was a perfect day to ride Splash Mountain, even if it was 59 degrees!!

We visited in the off season (February), but it turned out to be Winter Break week for schools in Southern California so the park was much busier than I thought it would be. It was very hard not to be constantly comparing the park to the Magic Kingdom - some stretches were identical. But the experiences were completely different. While the castle is smaller, you can actually walk inside it and see Sleeping Beauty's story. The Finding Nemo ride has you get inside a submarine and travel through a lake of water. The outside of the It's a Small World ride is pretty neat to see! With a working clock, the building comes to life every 15 minutes. So definitely not Florida, but it has its own treasures.\",\n",

We spent a week dropping in to both parks and found it was not up to the standards the used to have. Not sure if this was a timing thing or a bad week but we frequently heard people say and saw the garbage cans overflowing. The were Disney personal standing around not in the spirit and crowds that seemed in managed. It seemed this trip it was about packing as many people in as possible and not about keeping a good experience.One example was rides maintenance. One day alone we were in Li e for four different rides that come down with no option for a fast pass or something after waiting an hour or more. Now I know Disney needs to make money but they used to be know for the best experience as well and I worried they are losing that.It is still an ok place to visit but it is not what it once was.

While this is part of the Disneyland experience it felt like the park wasn't ready for such a large influx of people as security lines were absolutely massive and rides kept on being shut-down.Hyper Space Mountain in particular was frustrating as it shut down several ties during the day, At one stage we had been waiting in line for 90min when the ride was shutdown and the cast members asked everyone to vacate. We couldn't get fastpasses for later as the days allotment was already exhausted by 1pm. We came back later and managed to get a ride after waiting another 2 hours.We were lucky with the other rides but I heard stories that other people wern't so lucky - and experienced similar issues as we did with Space Mountain,Other than these kinds of issues, the day was amazing and even with the waits the vibe of the park topped us getting too frustrated about it,\",\n",

Going in the \"off-season\" was definitely a good idea, because the lines for the rides were a lot shorter, and the fast passes definitely helped too.

Living in San Diego, my parents made sure Disneyland was an annual trek for our family - I remember the days of coupon books, and our station wagon glove box was full of partially used ticket books (all the A & B coupons - LOL!), and admission was around $5. You could go for the day and ride every single good ride multiple times. Once, we went on Space Mountain TEN TIMES! Nowadays, ticket prices are well in excess of $100 and you\\'re lucky if you make it onto 3 rides. In December, we waited in line for Thunder Mountain three times. After an hour of waiting, the ride broke down. This happened twice more. Same happened on Indiana Jones. I finally complained that we had been in the park for more than five hours and had only managed to get onto one \"good\" ride (Star Wars) and a supervisor gave us a \"front of the line\" ticket to any premium attraction. After the third breakdown on Thunder Mountain, we decided to just leave the park. We went on a total of three rides. They do have a \"Fast Track\", but you\\'re only allowed to use that for one attraction at a time. Seriously, Disneyland just needs to limit the number of admissions to ensure guests can at least get on some rides. Very disappointed.

       " \"What's not to like about Disneyland Park! Well, it would have been nice if the Storm Troopers stopped so we could get of picture of the little ones with them. I truly think the thing I liked the most was the fact that we could bring water and our own food in to the parks. It gets very expensive to eat there all of the time. The bus system outside of the park is awesome.\",\n",
       " \"Disneyland never leaves you with regrets. There are so many rides, characters (especially for the kids), restaurants, shops and more to see and enjoy. You really need two days to see most of the park and enjoy many of the more popular rides. Hyperspace Mountain, The Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean.the Haunted House and many others. The park is divided into different areas so that you can go from area to area. At the end of the day is the 60th anniversary Main Street parade after dark. Lots of colorful fireworks, floats with the Disney characters, other characters and the Disney band. It's an extravaganza you don't want to miss. It's great for kids of all ages! If you take the little ones (they have a section for them, too), you may want to get a little leash to make sure they don't get lost in the crowds. The negatives we encountered was the price which has recently gone up and the waits in the lines for the rides. The food is expensive and the parking lot is quite large so be sure to get the tram that comes around to certain marked areas.\",\n",
       " 'It is a good family destination, however a bit costly. They will allow you to bring in you own food and have lockers to store your items until you are ready for them.

       " 'It was an amazing weekend at Disneyland with our family. It was our granddaughters first trip and her grandfathers birthday. The Disneyland park is too crowded due to the amount of yearly passes. In the future I would go during the week. That was our only disappointment.',\n",
       " \"Firstly I love Disney, love it. I've been to Euro Disney and Disney world Florida and have been planning this trip over a year. Our transport got us there around 10am. I decided to book a Tuesday as figured it would be less busy than a weekend. It was packed, the queues to get in to the park were an accurate reflection on what was expected inside. We could barely move between the sea of people, I appreciate there would be a lot of strollers bit seriously people use them as weapons to get through! Every ride was almost an hour wait and we only had 8 hours in the park. Got a pass for the Indiana Jones ride which was great....until it broke down midway and we had to be rescued (after they tried for 20 minutes to fix it before getting us out). Went to splash mountain and that was also broken down. Disneyland itself is beautify the castle is smaller but still impressive and the shops are gorgeous and attention to detail amazing.My boyfriend and I are very fast normally in parks but with a pass hopper we only got on 6 rides all day. It's a struggle to do in 1 day, most of the day is spent trying to get through the crowds, in lines or stuck on roller coasters (we were also stuck on California Screamin' which was closed once we got off).\",\n",

I was definitely surprised by how small Sleeping Beauty's castle is compared to Cinderella's in the Magic Kingdom but other than that, this park is really great! I was so happy to see Mr. Toad's Wild Ride which is sorely missed in Florida. And I was blown away by the Dole Whip! Why is there no Dole Whip at the Magic Kingdom? How is this not a thing??

We did \"old\" people stuff like the tiki room...yes it\\'s old school but so much fun. The Golden horseshoe skit saw my friend picked from the audience. She was thoroughly enchanted and it was fun to see Disney through her eyes. Staff was brilliant with the wheelchair as well.',\n",

Best place to ever take your kids, they will thank you for the rest of your lives. Please do not deprive your children of not having the experience to visit the most magical place on earth.\",\n",
       " 'RIDES AND CHANGES:I am intensely disappointed that Disneyland has essentially turned Tomorrowland into Star Wars Land.I always loved Space Mountain but I was really really disappointed that it has been turned into a Star Wars ride. I also noticed that Captain Eo is gone. I understand that Disneyland wants to upgrade but there are some things that really should just get a refresher. What they really need to do a full overhaul on is the It\\'s a Small World ride. The upgrades to that ride actually make it more creepy and kind of offensive....oh and by the way, who ever heard of ADVERTISING a company like Siemens in a children\\'s ride?! Come on Disneyland, seriously?! I was also disappointed by the new way they do Fast Passes where I have to wait until after the end time of my current one to get another one; that really is inconvenient when some rides put you many hours out into the future by 10am (like Indiana Jones...we got FPs for that ride at 10:30am and it told us to come back at 3:15pm so we couldn\\'t get any additional FPs until after 4:15pm). The Indiana Jones ride, by the way, broke down right before the start window for our Fast Pass, so they let us come back later. And then the end climax of the ride didn\\'t work so we had to ride it again. I remember that ride always seeming to have a ton of problems.CLEANLINESS: Now all these complaints aside...I\\'ve never seen Disneyland look so clean. I haven\\'t been since 2010, but prior to that I went nearly every year and this place is looking good.I was very impressed with how clean they keep the park even when there\\'s tons of people everywhere. VERY IMPRESSED.DIAMOND CELEBRATION PHOTOS:We also were there during the Diamond Celebration and we were able to get our photos taken on a photo pass at a whole bunch of different places. Although, I do want to mention that they should have better explained this somehow because we missed a lot of opportunities to do this because we didn\\'t figure out how to identify the spots where you could get photos on a pay pass until the last few hours of our visit. Yes, it\\'s in the guide, but it would just have been awesome to have a more in-your-face explanation. And buying all the photos is super cheap so that would have been even more cool. You can download an entire day\\'s worth of photos for $39 so if you hit every spot on the map for a special photo, you\\'d get probably 100 photos. And you can do it in California Adventure, too. My favorite one was the one where they had us hold out our hands and then in the final photo, Tinkerbell is totally sitting in our hands. It was awesome. I am just really sad that we didn\\'t get to take full advantage of all of that.FOOD (Really important if you have food allergies or intolerances) AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS:The restaurants for sitdown eating in both parks serve really excellent food. At one place we had cranberry apple salads with candied walnuts and apple vinaigrette and it was to die for! And cheap. It is a small salad off the appetizer menu but it was filling because it was full of fiber and it was $6. And in any restaurant I\\'ve ever been in with something like that, that kind of salad at that size is usually $8 or more so I found it to be a great value. The waiter was also fabulously nice. And I forgot his name which makes me mad at myself because I would have loved to write to Disney and tell them how incredible he was.We\\'re talking Top 5 service encounters of my adult life. In fact, I\\'d really put him Top 3 alongside the waiters that always serve me at Ruth\\'s Chris Steakhouse. Also, the guy who sold me my frozen chocolate dipped banana was adorable and awesome.And that reminds me. Congratulations to Disney on getting with the healthy program. I was a tad concerned about eating options because I have some food intolerances. There were food stands EVERYWHERE in Disneyland where I could buy huge apples (individually bagged for sanitation!), fruit cups, hummus cups, vegetable trays, even pineapple spears! And they even had Vitamin Water and Vitamin Water Zero. You pay a premium ($2 for an apple) but it was totally worth it because I realize that less people are taking those healthy options and the fact that they made this available to me was really important. We originally thought we\\'d have to leave the park during the day to eat or pack in a bunch of food and I brought a ton of medication to deal with my intolerances and then not having to deal with all of that was just soooo incredible and was a big stress relief.It was overcast nearly the entire time we were there and I feel that we never waited longer than about 30 minutes for a ride (Space Mountain was maybe 45 minutes but we were in line with a bunch of other people before the ride even opened for the day). Disneyland also seems a much happier place to work because my past trips have always had at least one bad encounter with an employee who clearly hated their job, but everyone I talked to was so nice. We stopped in the tavern in Fantasyland for dinner one night and the girl who runs and ushers the line was just so friendly, and there was another employee off shift in front of me in line who talked to me too the whole wait, too, and then the guy I talked to when I was waiting for my special order was also great. I want to point out again on the food front that everywhere I asked for a special order, the people were VERY NICE and very accommodating. I apologized for making it difficult and was told every time, \"You are not being difficult. You have a good intolerance and it is not a problem for us to accommodate that.\" And there was a pizza and pasta place in California Adventure where the manager came out and asked me if I would rather have my salad made in the back away from the possibility of cross-contamination, and when I said that was not a concern because a little bit of cheese wouldn\\'t kill me, he expressed that he didn\\'t want me to even have a little bit of discomfort. I am really surprised because we live in Utah and most places act like I\\'m cutting them off at the knees if I ask them to wrap a burger in lettuce instead of putting it on a bun or if I ask them to make my salad without cheese on top. These people were all amazing and it was really great to feel cared about.',\n",
       " \"Compared to Disney World, it's funny because it's all so short. I personally prefer Disney World, because World is less cramped and you can get around the parade mess. But I liked the New Orleans area and had a blast on Hyper Space Mountain.\",\n",
       " 'I had visited Disneyland many years ago when my husband and I were going to school in the summers for graduate degrees. I remembered how whimsical and magical it was. I enjoyed the revisit but it was quite crowded. My favorite restaurant is the Blue Bayou - it is worth a visit and the tab.',\n",
       " 'Been going to Disneyland since I was a little kid. Every year the ticket prices go up and the lines get longer. This time we were so shocked at how many rides kept going out of service all weekend. We paid over $700.00 for tickets for two adults and two kids for 2 days. After paying for parking and food and a few shirts I\\'m sure it cost me at least 1000.00 bucks. So many people were in the park it was hard to even walk around. Long lines for food, rides and bathrooms. Fast passes ran out quick and were not available. We spent so much time walking around trying to get on rides that were either out of service when we got there or went out of service while we were in line. Indiana jones, haunted mansion, Astro boasters, space mountain, cars, scream and big thunder railroad are just some of the rides that had technical problems and were closed off and on. Just not fun to stand in line for 40 min to have them announce \"Sorry we are having technical problems and the ride is temporarily closed\". No other information is given. Could be closed 5 min or 5 hours. I have never experienced this in all the years of going to Disneyland. I remember thinking as we were waiting for over 2 hours in line for the cars ride how we must all be brain washed to pay 700.00 to stand in lines all day and think it\\'s somehow fun. Don\\'t think we will return until they limit the number of people that are let in the park each day. Just not worth the price they are charging anymore.',\n",
       " 'This is a classic, what can I say? It never gets old. The new Star Wars themed rides were excellent, there were quite a few attractions that were down for repairs but we went in slow season & we new this. The cost of the parks have gone up but we knew that too. Still will return whenever we can.',\n",
       " \"I have been to Disneyland in over 30 years. It was changed. There were so many people there. We got there about 10am. I had to get a wheelchair to help me. I was was good. The wait wasn't as long. I finally went on Star Tours. It was fantastic and I loved it.\",\n",
       " \"Finally got my family to Disneyland. Really well presented park and spotlessly clean. Great rides and attractions but the wait for rides was huge. 2 hour wait for a 2 minute ride. I liked the park. Had a 5 day pass but no desire to return. Thought the rides at universal studio were heaps better. If you only have a day or two and can't decide what park to visit - go to universal studios\",\n",
       " \"A must do if in LA. Our favourite rides were in Tomorrow land, but this reflects our age. Loved Hyperspace Mountain - was long queues, so advise go get fast passes early. That said the 90min projected wait was just over 60,and it went fast cos we met some awesome people in the line. Also enjoyed Star Tours, but my group felt it could have been a bit longer. Apparently it used to be, but has changed. There were others aboard who I heard found the motion enough. Do the Matterhorn bobsleds, not as hair raising as California Screaming but a great ride(for those looking for something a tad tamer). Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is another exciting ride, we did it at night. Advise a fast pass if you can, this is the longest line we waited in. There's heaps for youngsters too. My only disappointment of the day was the Haunted Mansion. There was a breakdown and we sat for a while inside which was not a problem, but I felt the ride , ghosts etc were very tired and needs updating. The fireworks display was spectacular with a snow flurry drop on us at the end. A perfect way to end a holiday.\",\n",
       " 'This was a mother/daughter trip and our first visit to Disneyland. We’ve been to Disney World numerous times.We were in the park the last week in April. A variety of Disneyland travel “experts” predicted low crowd levels. They couldn’t have been more wrong. The crowd levels ended up being 8s, 9s, and 10s. Even the weekdays were unbearable. If I had known the parks were going to be that busy we wouldn’t have gone. The result was long lines for everything including food and restrooms. And, in addition to all the scheduled closures due to the construction of Star Wars Land, the unexpected ride closures just made everything worse. Pirates of the Caribbean and India Jones were down repeatedly. We waited in line for Autotopia for 45 minutes and it went down when we were next to ride. A cast member gave us a FP for Autotopia and Big Thunder Mountain for our troubles, which was greatly appreciated, but it was still an hour wasted when all was said and done. On our last day Indiana Jones was down for hours. Given the crowd levels, it also seemed they didn’t have enough help working at the restaurants. It took more than 40 minutes just to order at Bengal Barbeque.The fireworks were cancelled at the last minute every night due to high altitude winds. Extremely disappointing since this was probably our only trip to Disneyland. Plus, we saw people staking out spots for the nightly parade and fireworks 4-5 hours in advance – INSANITY!!! We did not join in that insanity. One night we chose a spot near It’s a Small World to watch the parade and just as the parade started the adults in front of us allowed their children to stand on the decorative wrought iron fencing on top of the retaining wall. I’m sure these are the same people who would sue when their child gets hurt. They ruined the view for everyone behind them. Unfortunately, a cast member never came by to tell the people to get down and they refused to listen to any other guests, so that resulted in others standing on the retaining wall to get a better view. The park definitely seemed understaffed.I tried using the Disneyland app to search for food and get wait times, but the wait times were not very accurate. In general, we waited an average of 60 minutes for a ride. However, our last day was so crowded we only managed to do three rides in 6 hours. We simply gave up and left the park.I found it hard to get around the park because there were so many people. We were constantly being run into by strollers and scooters. We experienced people cutting in line, being pushy and just being selfish and rude. We had to adjust our expectations based on the unexpected crowd levels. We were not able to do everything we hoped, but we tried to make the best of it. We still had lots of fun. You just need to pack lots of patience and manage your expectations accordingly.BEWARE: There were long lines for the restrooms and even to wash your hands. We observed MANY people skip washing their hands after using the facilities. Wash your hands frequently, keep your hands away from your face, and use hand sanitizer. Yuck!',\n",
       " \"This was our first trip to Disneyland & I have to say I was a little disappointment on how small the park is & the castle compared to Disney World castle. The kids had fun on some of the rides, but long lines & lot of people made it hard to enough our time there. What I don't like is that you have to wait hour in line to see a Disney or super hero character. Not what I remember growing up from Disney world when the characters would be walking around the park, taking pictures with you & signing auto graphs. Now you have to wait in long lines & if you don't get there early enough you miss the characters. The frozen characters (the one's the kids really want to see) you have to get there when the park first opens to get a ticket, if not then you miss your chances. The long lines, missing characters, price on things made the day not as special as I would've hoped. I can't believe too how expensive one day ticket is (I was lucky my dad gets a discount w/ his company.\",\n",
       " 'My daughter, 35 years old, talked us into going on this weekend trip. Two days at Disney and a day at another theme park kind of wiped us out. That being said, we had a great time. On Friday the park was crowded. On Saturday there was a mob. If you can swing it go on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday unless it\\'s a holiday. The crowds are smaller and the lines are shorter. I would recommend you get there as early as possible. They open at 8 AM in the summer. Hustle your buns to your favorite ride (Hyper-Space Mountain) get in line to ride it. When it\\'s done ride it again if the line is less than half an hour long. After the second time get a fast-pass and then explore the rest of the park. You can only have one fast pass at a time for Disneyland. Go to see the rest of the park until your fast-pass time then use it and get another when you would would like to go again. A little planning will go a long way once you get into the park. There are apps for smart phones that you can get that will give you wait times for the \"rides\" in the park. Do take in the shows as well. They are very entertaining and give you a chance to get off your feet for a while.Food and drinks are quite expensive in the park. Bring your own water bottle and fill it up at drinking fountains in the park. Restaurants are busiest at meal time so eat lunch at 2 PM instead of noon and you will have a shorter line. Eat dinner at 8 instead of 6. Lunch and dinner for a family of four including drinks will be about $80 for each meal. The portions are large so consider one meal for the kids to share if they will do that. You can take your own food into the park but remember you have to carry it until you consume it. Be sure not to use any mayonnaise or salad dressing in your food if you bring your own.Two day admissions are a good value. If you have a family of four, admission, parking, meals, and souvenirs for a day can easily be $1000. Usually you can go between Disneyland and California Adventures on the same admission. If you leave the park be sure to hang onto your ticket and get stamped on the way out. There are different attractions in the two parks so it\\'s worth while to go to both.I am a roller coaster nut and there are three in the two parks. There is Hyper-Space Mountain which is an excellent ride. Be sure to listen to the music and commentary on the ride. Thunder Mountain Railroad is fun but tamer. California Screamin\\' in California Adventures is a good outside coaster. Not the wildest I\\'ve been on but very nice. Tower of Terror in CA Adventures is also great. I would say all of the rides are appropriate for children that meet the height requirements.If you can go on a day that is raining most of the attractions will still be open and the lines will be very short and you won\\'t have to go on water rides to get wet. If is raining take an umbrella.We had a great time. Hope you will too.',\n",

It can seem like a long time, but they handle quest very well, and make sure you are also entertained even while waiting in line.After Disney bought Star Wars, several rides have star wars themes, which is not a bad thing if you're a fan.

They have many of the same attractions as DW, and some have a different twist. Biggest tip-if you have children who love Star Wars like mine, get to the park a half hour early, be at the opening, and run towards Tomorrowland to get on line for the Jedi Training. It closes out very fast! Our kids LOVED this! Best part of the whole thing. California Adventure has the actual Lightning McQueen, Red, and Mater, who drive in and pose for pictures like real characters. My 5 year old went bananas for that.',\n",

Would highly recommend it for all the family!!\",\n",
       " \"My daughter and I headed to Disneyland for a short, last-minute vacation. This was our third time at Disneyland (what can I say? we love it!) and it was as enjoyable as the last two visits. Maybe more so, in fact. May isn't peak time at Disneyland, especially around the Canadian long weekend. There are grad nights to contend with, so if hordes of unsupervised teenagers aren't your idea of fun, then stay away on grad nights. But I found they were mostly respectful and not a concern...just makes the lines a little longer. For the most part, the ride wait times weren't too long...actually some of the shortest we've seen before, in the 5-10 minute range, as opposed to the 60-minute range in the summer.Staff, as always, are friendly and helpful. You'll run into the odd grumpy, unhelpful cast member, but that happens everywhere and after dealing with crowds day after day after day, who can blame them?It's still the 60th celebration, which goes until September, so the fireworks and parades are all new and wonderful to celebrate.Would we go again? You bet!\",\n",
       " 'There is probably no time to visit this place and avoid the massively long lines except for tiny windows here and there. (ex: week after Thanksgiving..) However, I thought that since most of the schools in the US and Canada were still in session, that May would have been a good time to visit.I was WRONG...May is for graduates- high school, college, and middle school. We were overrun by the cap and gown crowds being bused in from all over California. There were also choirs, academic achievers, etc.. In fact, one group actually took over the Indiana Jones attraction and it was off limits to the general public. I don\\'t think that is fair, especially to people who come from thousands of miles and pay tons of money thinking they will get to see at least the most popular attractions.By booking all these large groups for May, I am sure Disney makes a profit. But, at what cost to the rest of us? Long lines (2 hours plus for \"Hyperspace Mountain!) combined with reduced hours ensure that, if you are lucky, you might make it to 5-6 rides. That is if you have a big bladder and don\\'t need to eat, drink, or rest. That means that each 2 minute ride is costing you about $20. Is it worth it? My kid loves Disneyland and seeing her delighted face is certainly worthwhile. But this place has become way too expensive. For a lot less you could go to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, buy the kids an all day, unlimited rides wrist brand, and you could sit on the beach and tan while they play. Sounds so much better than standing in endless lines for EVERYTHING at Disneyland, from rides to food to bathrooms. Those are chunks of your life you are never getting back.Plus, you\\'ll be walking...always walking. The gloriously underwhelming 60th anniversary has shut down the train, the monorail, boats, etc. To me, the whole 60th anniversary thing was over-hyped and poorly executed.Bottom line: Unless you are a huge Disney fanatic, or have kids that INSIST on Disneyland, save yourself a lot of time, hassle, and expense. If this is your once-in-a-lifetime trip to California, why not explore some of the other terrific places this state has to offer? Take the scenic route up the coast and visit some of the fantastic beaches, take surfing lessons, go to Yosemite, ride a cable car in San Francisco, lay on Pismo Beach and knock back a few beers...You will be less tired and less poor doing this than you will after visiting Disneyland/California Adventure.',\n",

We chose a weekend as it had extended hours for us to enjoy the fireworks and parades. It was pretty crowded as Dapper Days were happening that weekend.....very cool seeing how elaborately some people dressed. As excited as we all are about our visits to Disneyland we were a little disappointed with the 60th as opposed to the 50th anniversary. We were surprised with the amount of things that were closed down given all the hype and advertising for the 60th. Fantasmic is one of our favorites so we were wondering why that would be closed down during the 60th? We realize that it was because of construction, but the timing isn't the greatest. This probably wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but there were a lot of other things out of commission including the Monorail, Railroad, Matterhorn (only opened on weekends), and the Jungle Cruise was not open (although the reenactment was pretty funny). This seemed to be a lot of things down during a milestone celebration. We loved the new parade...it was spectacular and we loved the nod to the Electric Light Parade. Of course, we continue to be disappointed that Billy Hill no longer performs at the park. That was one of our big hi-lites each trip. We didn't even go into the Golden Horseshoe this vacation. While we always enjoy our visits, this one wasn't quite up to the standards we've experienced in the past due to all the closures. Perhaps the 60th shouldn't have been extended to 2016 if everything in both parks couldn't be opened.\",\n",

       " 'This was me and my boyfriends first visit to Disneyland Park and I was a little nervous about lines and kids.. Within a few hours in Disney my fears were put to rest. Disney did not miss a beat on our trip, I got my birthday pin and everyone at the park wished me happy birthday (felt so special). I would recommend getting there early and go right to Star Wars and get a speed pass for star tours, during our trip that ride had a wait time of 60 mins almost the whole day. we download the Disneyland App and they will take your pictures in the park and they are spend to your phone within 30 mins. Indiana jones was one of my favourite rides along with peter pan. Make sure you catch the electric prade at night and also would recommend the corn dogs, they are made on site and they are the best I have ever had.',\n",
       " 'My favorite ride by far. Definitely use a fastpass for it or get there first thing in the morning. The rest of the park had a few good rides but this was my favorite.',\n",
       " 'This was the third time my wife and I had been to Disneyland Park and this trip we treated all our immediate family, 11 of us from Australia, to an amazing holiday. It was brilliant. Disneyland Park keeps evolving, which is why some rides such as the Disneyland Railroad and Monorail were not operating at the time. However, an iconic ride that had not been operating on our two previous visits was – Autopia, which is one of the few original Disneyland rides still operating.The night parade is still amazing. Currently called Paint The Night, the lights, colour and creativity is brilliant.The Indiana Jones adventure is still my favourite ride and that has now been operating for 21 years. A more recent ride that is great fun is Buzz Lightyear and the Astro Blasters. The first ride on this was with my three year grandson and he had a great time shooting for points, scoring about a third more than I did. However, my score improved significantly with each ride.From my perspective, Disney is one of the best organisations in the world. They know exactly what their business is and generally they provide an experience, not just a series of rides or a performance.Although we had intended this Disneyland trip as a once-in-a-lifetime experience with all the family, my wife is already planning for everyone to go again in a few years’ time.',\n",
       " 'Disneyland is classic Disney and full of \"feel good\" activities. If you haven\\'t been in awhile, you\\'ll probably be excited by all of the Star Wars references and activities. Long lines and crowds everywhere but what else would you expect.',\n",
       " 'Disneyland is an overwhelming experience! Do your homework and get a lay of the land before you arrive!Tip 1: Get the App. Don\\'t argue with me on this one, GET IT! It helps you find characters, shows line times, where washrooms are...everything! We used it non-stop!Tip 2: But the photopass! The park has professional photographers sprinkled all over. Want a picture of your family with the castle behind you? You can have it! Ask your photographer for the card and then keep that card and pass it to the next photographer and they scan it. There is a small fee but you get access to beautiful high-end photos with characters, on all the rides and scenic locations. I brought my nice camera but still appreciated having these photos!3. FAST PASSES! Do it. When you walk through the gate (preferably morning) go straight to ride that offers fast passes that you know you want to ride(your app will tell you which ones offer them!) Grab a Fast pass for that ride then go on some other rides as the wait lines drastically increase hour by hour. You can only get one at a time BUT, it will say return between 10 and 11am, so at 10am you can get another fast pass. Just do this and save yourself some time!4. Mornings with Children! Always go right at gate opening! Its the only way with kids.5. Bring autograph books for the kids and permanent markers, all the characters will sign books and disney character stuffed toys!6. 3 days is needed. Day one, start in Frontierland/Adventure land rides. Day two rides and toontown, Day three, blitze all the characters and get autographs!7. Jedi Knight training for kids ages 4-12 is the cutest thing in the world. You have to sign your kids up first thing in the morning. If you show up on a magic morning day, they start registration right at 8am so get to the launch bay right away!8. There\\'s a starbucks!!!! Holy frick, I lost my mind when I discovered I could stay caffeinated! (Its on the main street and there is no outdoor advertising other than \"coffee\" outside)9. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays are \"Magic Mornings\" for those who carry a three day or more pass purchased online. I thought it would be \"quieter\" but it was actually busier in my opinion. It may have been that it was a Thursday when we used it but Tuesday was hands down the quietest day we experienced.10. Gotta hand it to Disney for phenomenal marketing and the way they cater to families. Every \"Cast Member\" was exceptional and incredibly friendly. Wonderful trip!',\n",
       " 'We\\'ve been to Disney multiple times and wanted to see the special events for the 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration. Even though the anniversary was technically 2015, they have extended the special parades/fireworks through the fall. We visited in mid-May hoping it would be a little less crowded, but I\\'m not sure you experience Disneyland without crowds unless you go when it is raining. There were LOTS of people in the park - season pass holders had no restrictions for the time period we were visiting, so perhaps there were a lot of locals there. We visited three days from Sunday to Tuesday. Sunday was the most crowded, but also had the most going on in terms of parades and shows. We were able to see the Soundsational parade in the afternoon and the new Paint the Night Parade in the evening. We did the Aladdin Oasis dinner package so we could get seating in a reserved viewing area across from It\\'s a Small World. The food was not impressive, but we were able to eat our boxed meal at Aladdin\\'s Oasis, which was truly an oasis away from all the crowds. The area reserved for viewing was good, but arrive a little earlier than 30 minutes before the show. We came at that time and most of the areas up front were already filled with people with strollers. You can also stay in this area to view the fireworks and see the show projected on the front of It\\'s a Small World. The Paint the Night Parade is really exceptional. The floats are marvels of engineering and special effects and the dancers that accompany the big floats have wonderful costuming. It was worth our visit just to see the parade and we made sure to see it each night. The fireworks show is also very good and very nostalgic, featuring Tinkerbell, Winnie the Pooh, and other favorites. The park is decorated with special anniversary banners and the castle is transformed into a sparkling silver blue masterpiece. Be sure to get your photo taken in front of the castle. Also, if you want to see the Mickey and the Map live show, be aware that it may not be available during all weekdays or there may be fewer performance times. There are special mouse ears for the anniversary and my girls wanted to get them to match the golden ears they got at the 50th anniversary. On this trip we also enjoyed the Disney Band that performs on main street and at the flag retreat. The day we watched the flag retreat they asked members of all the branches of the service to come forward when the band played their anthem. It was exceptionally moving. If you have Star Wars fans, Tomorrowland has been given a makeover with special Star Wars meals available, a quick movie synopsis of the films, and most importantly, a re-envisioning of Space Mountain to include Star Wars music and visuals. It was a nice addition to the park while the new Star Wars area is being built. Now for the not so good news: The train is not running around the park during construction, so if you are used to using the train to take a break from fighting the crowds while getting to another \"Land,\" then you will have to get used to slowly milling with the throngs of people as you cross the park. In addition, the passway from Fantasy Land to Big Thunder Mountain is also closed, funneling even more people through the center of the park. When we visited, crowds were not at full volume, but it was still a challenge. If you have the option of doing a Magic Morning, grab it, because you can visit a lot of rides, especially in Fantasy Land before the park begins to fill. But I wouldn\\'t waste your hour of time on Peter Pan\\'s Flight unless you happen to be one of the first few people in line for the Magic Morning. We found everyone made a beeline to Peter Pan\\'s flight and the line quickly swelled to a 45 minute wait. We decided to go visit other rides and quickly rode about 6 attractions and then came back to Peter Pan where the line was actually a bit shorter. The line tends to stay about 45 minutes all day long, so just accept the wait as part of your day. Although I will say that weather in Anaheim tends to have cloudy mornings and sunny afternoons. There is no shade in the queue area for Peter Pan, so doing the ride in the morning when there is cloud cover will be more comfortable. Obviously, try to make use of the Fast Pass system (it\\'s more efficient to send one member of your group with all the tickets to get the passes than dragging everyone around the park) but flexibility is also important. We happened upon the Flag Retreat Ceremony and also a live Mary Poppins performance in front of the castle and these spontaneous moments were some of the best memories from the trip.',\n",
       " 'We had an amazing time with our 2, 6, and 7 year old. If you get there right at opening you can get on lots of rides and no lines!',\n",
       " \"This was my first time going here and I wasn't disappointed at all! I had two day hopper tickets and stayed at a good neighbor hotel. I would recommended getting there before they open! We enjoyed the experience a lot better and got in five rides before noon when the crowds started getting to much for us. The next day we got there the same time and got pictures with characters about five until we gave up and did the rides. The characters were randomly all over the park and the lines were a lot shorter then expected. I defiantly recommend getting there early (crowds start pouring in around noon), plan ahead (read up on the website, buy tickets for both parking and the park before you go)and I'm sure you will have a magical experience !!! Most stop st The World of Disney for all your souvenirs :)\",\n",

       " \"I've always loved Disneyland, having visited the California park twice as a child and the Orlando resort twice in the last 4 years, on a recent trip to LA I thought I would re-visit the original Disney. Big mistake and an even bigger waste of money.Once through the gates it becomes very difficult to negotiate your way around the park as you are met by a sea of people, push chairs and scooters. Queuing times for all rides were in excess of an hr and this was mid week out of peak season. After 7 hrs in the park we only managed to get on 4 rides which was quite annoying given that we'd paid $135 for a ticket.When the parade began things got worse as a melee of people gathered to watch it and a stampede began during which I witnessed people and bollards being knocked over several times. There was little crowd control and it was quite apparent that too many people were in the park.If you want the Disney experience visit Orlando. Disney California is a waste of time and money, greed has removed all enjoyment. You will queue excessively for rides, queue for ice cream and even queue for the toilet. Not a pleasant way to spend the day.\",\n",
       " \"Magical! I've been to Disney World more times than I can remember, but hadn't been to Disneyland since I was 13. It was well worth another visit, especially with the Disneyland Forever theme going on. The fireworks made me tear up with the Walt nostalgia. Paint the Night Parade was a bit of a Main Street Electrical Parade throwback but with it's on uniqueness. And the park itself was so fun. Some classic rides and some you can only do in Disneyland (Toad's Wild Ride/Matterhorn) - and even the ones you can also see in Disney World just might have some subtle differences that makes doing the attraction a must. We look forward to going back and see what else changes and what stays the same!\",\n",
       " \"The best thing i can recommend is to visit during a weekday. You don't want to spend all your hard earned money on a one-day ticket, just to spend most of the day waiting in line for your favorite rides. I suggest picking a weekday if your'e visiting the area, to avoid the large weekend crowds.This is also true for holidays, you can forget about christmas....The crowds are horrendous. If you're lucky, and there's a little rain, that will also keep the crowds at bay. Do some research, and see if your favorite rides or attractions will be available to get the most out of your trip.All that being said, I am a passholder and have been for many years. My friends and I always have a great time at Disney. There is so much see and do, and the fireworks show is a must. If you plan it out right, you will not be dissapointed.\",\n",
       " 'I have been to this park multiple times as a child and as an adult. My spouse and I go every 5-10 years to either here or Disney World. It brings back the kid in me! I go around with a silly happy grin. Sure there are too many people there at times making lines super long, but go mid-week, not during the summer or any vacation/holidays, go early in the day, use a Fast Pass when available, and go into the single rider line for really long waits. The stuff going on around, movies, character meets, exhibits, shows, etc, all add to the attraction that Disney holds. This is a multi-day park, as the rides and the spaces where you stand in line all have something fun to read or look at. We usually go for 2-3 days with a Park hopper, go one day to California Adventures with a visit in the evening for fireworks and other shows, then 2 days in Disneyland Park. We did notice this time that there were some cast members who didn\\'t seem as thrilled to be there as they normally look. A few were in a hurry to get to their break so when we asked a cast member probably on his way to his lunch, he sort of answered as he continued walking, and there were some with less than happy faces, but at other times we ran into sweepers who would chat with us about some show or event we ought to go to or a ride that had a hidden interesting object. Overall we thot the staff was ok, just not as \"happy\" as some of our past visits.Also, during less popular times, some rides are shut for maintenance. Unfortunately, Pirates of the Caribbean and its restaurant were closed during our visit, but some of the others, like the Matterhorn that was said to be closed actually opened while we were there',\n",
       " 'Just had our first trip to DLR and it is better than Magic Kingdom in my opinion. Ride against ride it wins almost every time. The only issue is the crowds, wow it was crazy busy.',\n",
       " 'Great experience for kids and adults. Lots to do and lots of shopping or food available too. For increased riding by adults, try the single rider option on Indiana Jones and the Matterhorn. Best food deal was the mangos and grapes sold at stand in Frontier Land or on Main Street. The fruit was really fresh and sweet.',\n",
       " \"There is a fair amount of refurbishing going on to get ready for the summer season but if anything it was an advantage because the crowds were smaller.

       " 'We love taking an adults Disney trip every few years! Here are a few tips and our favorite things to do if you\\'re going as adults and in a small group:-Get to the park at opening. Yes, there will be families there at the same time, but in my experience they head toward Fantasyland or stop for breakfast, etc. Hit the busiest rides first, before they get too crowded...Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Indiana Jones, etc. -Utilize \"single rider\" passes! Many rides offer these. You\\'ll still get to hang out together during the line, and you most likely will not sit together, but it is a good way to ride the popular attractions without wasting hours in line. There are times we have ended up seated in the same vehicle. We use this option for Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Radiator Springs Racers, California Screamin, etc. -Get Fast Passes for the rides you can\\'t do Single Rider (or don\\'t want to separate on)...Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Tower of Terror...-Blue Bayou is a fun option for lunch or dinner',\n",

It was good, but you need to do your homework.We only had 1 day so decided to do the original park. Maybe a mistake with the age of our children but still had fun (and they dont love scary rides).Thinks to do -1. Get their early (we drove from downtown (weho)and drive was okay (against most traffic)2. Use the fast past ticket line system (have a good read of how it works)3. Go in a clock wise direction (after getting fast pass for the busy rides)4. Try to go mid week, non holidays in winter5. Talk your kids out of waiting in line for the matterhorn (2 hour wait the day we were there with no fastpass)6. Remember were you parked your car (the carparks are huge)7. Have fun & takes lots of cash',\n",

       " \"As our last visit here was 3 years ago and was pretty bad, we had expected about the same.However, the ride lines were shorter! In short we had fun!The coolest thing was we went on May 4, but chance, not plan. The park was a full of star wars , and when we went on Space Mountain our minds were blown as they changed the ride to Hyper Space mountain!!!!! This is the coolest upgrade I have seen! if you haven't been on this ride in a while you must go!\",\n",
       " 'This is great place to take your little one. I was amazed to see my daughter\\'s face when she was looking at fantacyland castle , characters dancing in parade ....I hope to come back there. You should plan your trip properly , reach there by 9:30 AM at least to see different characters at the main street (main entrance) .... It is advisable to complete fantacyland first as those become crowded later & those closes first too....\"It\\'s Small world\" is mast if you are taking your children. You can target to go there by 2:30 so that you finish that up by 3:30 pm. After that you take some place in the same street to see the parade which starts from Main street (entrance) at 4:30 PM. Don\\'t forget to take mat to sit on the street. You can enjoy different rides there after that.Later half you can target adventure park & other area & walk towards main street for Mickey\\'s soundasation Parade starts at 8:30 /8:45 PM. Again its best you reserve some place on the street earlier to best enjoy the show. Later you can stay there for firework, Unfortunately on 14th , due to weather, it was cancelled which something you need to be ready too :(.Please carry the following - cap, sun glass, sunscreen, Mat, lots of water. Don\\'t get trolley bag because trolley bags are not allowed.jackets/sweaters (as sometime its very windy, your children might feel cold).Overall, its really great place to visit.',\n",
       " \"We visit often and enjoy it in different ways at different times. Fast pass is great. Find out about it and use it! When walking through the park, don't just follow the herd. Keep your eyes open and you will find places to walk that are less crowded at times. Last two hours and first two hours are obviously the least crowded. We could list 100 tips but the biggest thing is just enjoy. Do what your KIDS want to do. Make sure they have fun.\",\n",
       " \"Wow not sure when Disneyland became so overcrowded during the week, but during this visit the crowds were excruciating! The lines were long and while fast pass was an improvement it also led to more walking. As older folks traveling without kids it was bad enough, but couldn't imagine if you had a toddler. Glad we broke up our 3 day Disneyland visit with a trip to Universal Studios where the crowds were much lighter and the lines short. Still have to love Disneyland and when the grandchild is old enough will be back for more!\",\n",

Carsland is excellent as well as many of the rides being some of yhe best in the world. What an experience.\",\n",
       " \"I've always been a fan of Disneyland, having visited the California park twice as a child and the Orlando resort twice in the last 5 years so during a recent trip to Anaheim I couldn't wait to re-visit the original park. Sadly I was disappointed; Disney California lacks the Disney magic and doesn't have the same vibe. The park felt claustrophobic and vastly over crowded due to the sheer number of people that were pouring through the gates all day long. It was difficult to walk from one area to the next as thousands of people swarmed around. After 5 hrs we only managed to go on 3 rides owing to the 1.5 hr long queues, there was a 30 minute queue for ice cream, a 30 minute queue for coffee and a 15 minute queue to use the filthy restrooms. This is far from Walt Disney's vision.\",\n",

I was re-living all my childhood television dreams. Star Wars was fantastic but I am a fan. Everything else I loved. We had 3 day passes but I think I would have liked longer. Loved the parade, loved watching the kids faces. Just the best place to go and the highlight of our USA trip',\n",
       " 'It continues to evolve and grow, within its boundaries. The new Star Wars exhibition in Tomorrowland is brilliant. A display of props and videos of behind the scenes. They have interactive games. We had a brilliant time just a shame our favourite ride Pirates of the Caribbean was closed again for the length of our stay, it was closed when we visited 2 years ago. There are a great choice of fast and slow rides, a great choice of food and drink available throughout.',\n",
       " \"If you go to Disneyland get the 3 day park hopper. There is just too much to do in both parks and you really need 3 days to do it all. Bring extra money for food because the food is amazing and you need to try it. Learn to use fast passes and be smart about them. Aside from Peter Pan you should never have to wait more than 30 minutes if you use your fast passes right. It's a great place and time flys by when you're there!\",\n",
       " 'We arrived on a Monday and found it quite busy but by using our fast pass we were able to get on most of the rides that we wanted to visit. The ship and paddle wheel river boats and other things on the water were out of service. The weather was actually pleasant during the visit but we needed a jacket in the evenings to stay warm. We made use of the lockers for $7.00 (small lockers) to keep our jackets, snacks and a few water drinks. All food within the park is expensive as one might think. We did eat at the Mexican food place (sorry forgot the name) by the indoor shooting range and found that to be good. The parade in the evening was wonderful as was the fireworks. One is normally tired by the time the parade comes along but waiting for the parade and the fireworks is worth it in my opinion. Wonderful. The hardest part is finding a place to watch the parade since people line up some time ahead. One of the friendly park staff helped us find a place where we could stand and watch.',\n",
       " \"Disneyland is great, so great in fact that it's become ridiculously overcrowded during peak days. It's essential the plan your visit ahead of time in order to maximize time spent having fun and minimize time spent standing in lines. Download the Disneyland app (iOS or Android) to help you manage your time efficiently, plus important things like food and restrooms. Don't lug around a big bag of junk, rent a locker and retrieve stuff as needed. They even offer lockers with built-in phone chargers! Check the events schedule so you can watch the parades & shows that interest you and avoid the pedestrian gridlock of the ones that don't. Bring bottled water and maybe some single-serve drink mixes, the restaurants will let you refill from the drink fountains. Most importantly, DON'T BRING BABIES OR TODDLERS!! They cost you a ticket, pushing a stroller through crowds will make you miserable, and the kids won't remember anything anyway.Attractions are constantly being updated, so this ain't your dad's Matterhorn. Space Mountain, Star Tours, Indiana Jones Adventure and Big Thunder Mountain have all been recently refreshed.Disney is also aggressively re-theming to Star Wars, and to a lesser extent Marvel, so expect to see characters like Chewbacca and Iron Man wandering around next to Ariel and Cinderella. As part of the new Star Wars Land construction, the railroad and everything associated with Rivers of America (Mark Twain riverboat, Fantasmic show, Tom Sawyer island etc) are shut down until construction is complete.In short, prioritize the activities that are most important (rides or parade?, sit down to eat or grab 'n' go and eat while you wait?), and plan as much of your visit around those. Be prepared for miles of walking, carry only what you need, leave the little kids at home, and most of all have fun.\",\n",

       " 'PATIENCE……… We visited Disneyland on 05/18. It was crowded with many high school “senior day” kids. In fact, one of the parking lots was closed just for those busses to park. I would recommend not visiting during mid-May to late June. This is the graduation season and many visitors are in the park. Upon arrival, you will find that parking is $18 for cars and motorcycles (unless you have an annual pass that includes parking). After parking you will catch a tram to the entrance plaza of Disneyland / California Adventure and will go through a cursory security screening. A word of advice SELFIE STICKS ARE PROHIBITED within the park. After passing through security, you proceed to the entrance kiosk and enter Disneyland. Upon entering, you are on Main Street, USA, and gateway to the lands of imagination of Walt Disney. From here in a clockwise direction is Adventure land, New Orleans Square, Critter Country. Frontier land, Fantasyland, Mickey’s Toontown and Tomorrow land. Check the website for attractions that are closed for renovation. Even being packed people are moved orderly and quickly. Utilize the fast passes that are available. Tips: be prepared for a lot of walking and standing Start early, pace yourself and end late. Exit the park to eat, much cheaper (Bring your own water and snacks) Use the FASTPASS for those rides you really want to go on but do not want to wait in a long line. If you want to eat at the BLUE BAYOU – call ahead for reservations.  Stay and watch the parade and fireworks show. Watch out for strollers, they are notorious heel biters.  MOST IMPORTANT THOUGH – ENJOY YOURSELF. See it though the eyes of a child. IT IS A MOST MAGICAL PLACE.',\n",

An acquaintance on the same trip with us joined us for the day and we were all really impressed and totally enjoyed the day. The cost is very reasonable, the level of detail put in to every aspect of the park is incredible. The rides are worth the wait, comprehensively represent the stories they are based on and are enjoyable and educative. Service is great everywhere. After we left we noted that we hadn't seen anyone smoke or drink alcohol at all during the day. While there were masses of people there we also didn't see any rudeness, pushing in queues, arguing, or even any unhappy children. With so many kids there you would expect some tantrums but it genuinely was like we'd walked under some pixie dust at the entry as all we saw was happiness all day. Despite some long waits for some rides, they have signs with wait times and we learnt the wait was less than the signs said. Also the waits are moving through castles and buildings that are part of the ride and story experience so it mostly isn't like a wait as you take in the building story and artefacts. We initially weren't going on the Nemo ride as we thought it was for young kids, but later the line was short so did, and all three of us considered it a highlight. The parade and fireworks blew my mind, amazing, and to think they do it every single night. We were staying at the opposite end of LA and people told us it would be hard and expensive to get there - wrong! We got an Uber, it cost about $40 US, when we left a car was there so no wait and the cost was about $45US - money well spent and the trip was less than an hour. There are an extensive range of souvenir shops with quality products at decent prices. Budget for this! Plan for a big day & stay till the end to enjoy the parade and light show. The rides get quieter after about 430. Buy some mouse ears and wear them with pride amongst the masses.

She also stopped watching most of the characters so we did not have to wait 2hrs in line to see Mickey. Over the few years crowds get bigger, lines got longer, facilities stay the same. I must admit stuff is extra nice and place is very clean considering how many people are there. It just was not designed for so many people.',\n",

Before you leave DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE; you will get a stamp on your left hand – this is your ticket to get in to DISNEYLAND (vice versa) When you get to the entrance, the Disney friends (people who work there I call them friends ‘cause they are so happy LOL) they will check the stamp and you are good to go. When you walk in, you’ll see Sleeping beauty’s castle and Tomorrow Land on it’s right side. We went to Tomorrow Land first to try the STAR TOUR ride and it was really cool. I really enjoyed that! After we finished the ride, it was ALREADY JAMMED PACK BUSY. It got a little claustrophobic; but still fun.Then we tried walked to Sleeping Beauty’s castle and took pictures. The gentleman who took our pictures was really friendly and nice. Then we wanted to try the Snow White Ride; at first line up was moving but everything shut downed for 5 minutes and station were running again. After 10 minutes, power went out again and we were told that we have to wait another 10-15 more minutes so we just walked out. No big deal, things like that happen and people are still happy. After that, we just tried the carousel. LOL (we were lame because we were in time sensitive case and we didn’t really take full advantage of the park hopper). Our last ride was “it’s a small world” and that was very relaxing and calm; then when we got out we were on time for the Disney Parade of Mickey and Friends. I also cried watching that parade but I was so overwhelmed buy HOW HAPPY AND ENERGIZED the crowd was. After the parade we walked around and found some souvenir shops and went to Starbucks at Downtown Disneyland. We left the park at 7:30. We did miss the fire works and all the fun stuff that happens at night but I will surely be back here!!',\n",

They can tell you months in advance which rides will be down on which month.\",\n",

They don't have any reasonably priced meals. Everything is outrageously expensive. $14 salads. $10 hamburgers. There has to be something that families can afford to eat at the park while they're there. This is why I gave them only four stars out of five.\",\n",

The morning wasn't too bad but after lunch the crowd was too much and we left for an early dinner (which we had a reservation for anyway).The park is small and would be easy to navigate and get on all the rides conveniently if it wasn't so overcrowded! Create a plan of action and use fastpass where possible! The crowd calendars on all the Disney blogs/websites are way off this year! Paint the Night parade is a must see but find a spot early (like 90 mins early!) We had an obstructed view (sat outside Carnation Cafe) but could manage to see most of it and it's incredible! The staff here is not typical Disney employees. We found the employees in Florida and CA Adventure way friendlier! I know this park is going through alot so maybe moral is down. The fireworks were cancelled the night we were in the park due to high winds, if windy, you will see a white balloon being launched and that means they are testing the winds in the atmosphere. We did manage to catch them the next night when we were leaving CA Adventure.Castle is best viewed close up and nicely decorated for the 60th anniversary celebration.\",\n",

The best part, and compulsory if you want the real Disney experience, is the parade at night and the fireworks. You can't leave the park without seeing them.

       " 'We stayed at the first part of april with 5 day park hopper tickets. There were 4 children ages 6,7,8,9 and the two of us adults. The kids have never been to the park before and we have only been once. As we entered disneyland park the thing that the kids were most excited about was the train. They wanted to ride the train. For all five days we were there the train was down out of service but you could take a picture? Whoo hoo! This was dosappointing for 2 reasons. One the kids love trains and that was something they were looking forward to doing, and two its a lkng walk to het the kids around the park to all the areas when they are that young. During 2 different days at the park we went to ride the indian jones ride whicb left us waiting in line for hours because it broke down, and there were many parts of the ride that were not working when we did finally get to ride it. These are just a few things that were disappointing about the park. There were other rides out of comission. Lines that lasted for over an hour and a half. These wait times are to be expected, but there were even half hour wait times for the fastpass lines. And then not being able to get more than 2 fast passes on your ticket is a great fault. We could have gotten 5 fast passes for rides and made everyone of them with a shorter time but were not allowed more than 2. Just overall a bad crummy experience.  Unless myself or my family ever won a free vacation there, We will not be back.',\n",

Yes, it was probably very expensive for only one afternoon, but when you can meet your adult daughter and spend the afternoon with her and she wants to ride the Dumbo ride with her Daddy, you spend anything. They even road the Tea Cup ride and I got a video just like when she was a little bitty thing. Enjoyed the entire afternoon.',\n",

It is expensive but it is worth going. The coaster rides are all interesting and I highly recommend seeing both the firework in Disneyland and light show in California Adventure Park. If you are here this year, highly recommend to watch the \"Paint the Night\" parade. The parade song still stuck in my brain two weeks after my visit! The parades were wonderful and magical!I especially commend the staff in Disneyland Park for their dedication and help throughout my visit.

There was so much that we didn't do, simply because we didnt want to line up for an average queue of 45 mins. Lines that long just take the fun out of it !We watched the Paint the Night Parade and loved it, they did a beautiful job of it and the people that created it are amazing but what happened afterwards was terrible.We tried to get out of the park and ended up being heard like cattle with 1000's of other people. It was dangerous. We had to carry our son because it was too dangerous to allow him to walk.If some emergency had of happened, nothing would have been able to done because of how crazy the crowds are.

It may have been expensive, but I thought that it was definitely worth the money.....the food was fabulous, and being part of the Pirate of the Caribbean ride was awesome, and having the VIP reserved area to see the parade and fireworks - really made the whole Disney experience spectacular!!!The Jolly Holiday bakery, even though it didn\\'t stock the usual bakery items like Meat Pies, Pasties and Sausage Rolls, still had fabulous food that was reasonably priced!!!

You can check online before you go to see if major rides are scheduled to be down for an extended period of time. We are moving into summer, and the park is going to get crowded, so purchase your tickets ahead of time to skip that part of the line, be there when the park opens, take a break at your hotel during the hot/crowded part of the day, and return to close the park in the evening. If you can handle missing the parade, the crowd is drawn to the parade, so that\\'s a great time to be in Adventure or Frontier Land. There is a nice view of the fireworks from near Splash Mountain, and it\\'s not crowded. Avoid Tomorrow Land at parade time. Walking through there is difficult due to crowds.

Seems like their objective is to let way too many people in the park that you would be lucky, if you could even experience 4 or 5 rides.

It wasn't even crowded, but my husband and I started to walk into two different restrooms and couldn't use them, we walked right out because they were so filthy!!!We rented a locker and it was filthy too!!! Also, the last 3 visits there, the ponds were so full of algae, they smelled and there were very few ducks!!! I don't blame the ducks, they didn't like that mucky water either!!! We were sitting and eating and got whiffs of the stench. It was a real turn off. They are letting things go. It is so expensive there and they have raised the price of parking, admission, the food and then so many attractions are closed!!! What a rip off!!! We aren't renewing our pass.Walt Disney would be furious!!!\",\n",
       " \"We just returned for a trip to Disneyland last night. It was our first trip in about 5 years.My girls and I used to have annual passes for about 5-6 years in a row, and we would frequent Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure (DCA) often. We stopped renewing our annual passes because we had so much of Disney were content to take a break so we could enjoy other things. Now after years of absence we are back with an annual pass. Annual passes are convenient for us since we only live 118 miles north of the Disneyland Resort. We were there for 3 days from 5/9/16 - 5/11/16. We rode almost every ride in both parks. There were several new rides in DCA since our last visit when the Ariel ride was under construction. Other additions include Cars Land, and the World of Color show. Cars Land is super cute and fun, with detail that can only come to life from Disney. In fact Radiator Springs Racers is now in a tie with Toy Story Mania as being our favorite ride(s) in DCA. World of Color is a pure Disney Magic show that is worth the time. I would recommend using magic morning hour in DCA for the Radiator Springs Racers since the line is consistently long all day.Not much has changed in Disneyland park with the exception of Tomorrowland practically being turned into a Star Wars attraction. Since I'm a fan of Star Wars, I'm cool with the changes. My 13 year old daughter isn't a fan of star wars, but still liked the attractions, so even people who aren't huge star wars fans still enjoy themselves.The only negative things I experienced on the trip were that both the Disneyland Monorail and the Disneyland Railroad are closed for refurbishment at the same time.This is a huge concern, especially if anyone in your party has a disability or mobility issue. Both the monorail and train are used for transportation to/from and around the park, so with both being closed at the same time a visit to the park now requires much, much more walking than normal. If you use and/or rely on the monorail for transportation due to a disability, you might not want to visit Disneyland until both are up and running again because you will be walking a lot more than normal.All the extra walking made not only my feet hurt, but a bone tumor I have in the distal fibula in my left leg. My feet and ankle were in constant pain after our first day. The pain got so bad I couldn't relax and actually enjoy myself like I usually do. Instead of looking forward to riding the rides for the entertainment value, I was looking forward to sitting so I could rest my feet and ankle. In my opinion the decision to close both modes of transportation at once was a poor decision made by Disney. I believe positive consideration for Disney would be to offer something to disabled people to compensate them for the extra walking required. Please see the picture regarding transportation.My other complaint is that I got injured an the Peter Pan's Flight ride. We had just boarded the ride, and I was getting settled on the seat when the ride operator jerked the ride to a sudden stop. We experienced whiplash just like a low impact rear ending, and it hurt my lower back. I literally not only felt my back pop/crack but also heard it.Since then I've been in constant pain having to take pain pills just to finish the trip. I made a doctor appointment and plan to get x-rays.\",\n",

When you go to theme parks be prepared for long lines and heavy crowds and start early and leave late. Take time to rest, stay hydrated and eat right.

       " \"Both my Wife and I visited Disneyland on the first day of our trip around the Western USA. I was fortunate to visit Disneyworld in Florida back in 95 and so wanted to visit where it all began 60 years ago.Disneyland has to be seen to be believed! It is located in Anaheim and is easily accessible by car or if you are staying local by ART Transit Bus (Cheap with friendly drivers). On arriving you are whisked through security lines then a queue for the entrance. Learning throughout the day the queues are well managed and you do get through them pretty quickly! We spent most of the day collecting signatures from most of the characters and basically taking the place in. All the people in character were very friendly and very patient. Can't fault at all. We did stop for a drink and a quick bite to eat which bear in mind would not be cheap if you are in a family group. The park on the day was absolutely rammed with people, but to be fair it was kept very clean even though unfortunately some people do like drop their rubbish on the floor!!To sum it up you will need two days if you want to do the rides and collect signatures from characters. This is without going next door to the Disneyland Adventure Park next door. The day we visited there were a lot of attractions closed to make way for a new Star Wars feature in the park. For the price of $99 for a day ticket, these closed rides made the price very steep in our point of view. If you traveling with families, book the longer passes as it would work out better value.

Most bad reviews are from clueless people who don't understand what a trip to Disney entails. There are slower times that can be found by searching the Internet for crowd charts.

       " 'On April 25th-28th 2016, my wife and I spent three days visiting the Disney Parks at Anaheim California. This was our first visit to Disneyland, we have visited the Orlando Disney Parks in three occasions.Most of our time was spent at Disneyland. We selected the time of our visit (after Easter and before Summer) on the assumption that it would be less crowded. Well, we could not have been more wrong. The crowds were enormous, and the lines and waiting times were very long, usually around 30-45 minutes. In many cases it was nearly impossible to move around the parks without bumping into people or nearly hitting some baby stroller.We used the fast passes whenever possible, but for some attractions, we had to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more. Adding to our frustrations was that in several instances, after standing in line for 30 minutes or so, the attraction or ride suffered some sort of mechanical problem. This was exactly what happened to us on the Peter Pan ride. When we almost reached the end of the line, there was some sort of mechanical problem, and no one could tell us whether the ride could go back in operation. Because, of this, and because there was no easy exit from the line, we had to jump over barriers and ropes. This was difficult considering our ages.That sort of annoyance also happened at the Winnie the Pooh ride. A similar, and even more frustrating situation happened to us with the \"Rollicking Roadsters\" at the California Adventures Park. It took us three attempts to finally get on this ride which broke down twice.The Anaheim parks seem to be smaller than the Orlando ones, this perhaps adds to the crowded conditions we encountered. Also, Disneyland does not offer Meal Plans or on- line fast passes. I must also add that in all our visits to Orlando Parks we never encountered so many rides and attractions out of service or breaking down.Our recommendation is that if you want to enjoy the \"Disney Magic\", you should go to Orlando and during off season times. The parks are larger, they seem to be less crowded, and there are better services, more attractions, more conveniences, and lodgings options..We did little in terms of shopping at the parks or at Downtown Disney, but we were shocked by the high prices of food, drinks, souvenirs, etc. Perhaps there was a time when Disneyland was the \"Happiest Place on Earth\", but that seems to be long in the past.',\n",

       " \"I don't know how they do it but it truly is a magical place. We had a 5 day park hopper but unfortunately our son was sick for the final day. Disney refunded our last day which was very much appreciated. We met so many characters and using the fast passes makes everything a little easier. I didn't get to try a Dole Whip so I guess I'll have to start planning another trip!\",\n",
       " \"Have been to Disneyland many times over the past half century and always was impressed with the management of the Park...until this time. Lines were impossible, litter on the ground, many closed attractions, mean staff pushing people aside during the night time parades, grout/coping missing around tiles, ran out of silverware at the French Market restaurant during lunch and no one clearing the tables when everyone was looking for a clear table to sit down, faucets not working in bathrooms at Disney Grand Hotel in the main lobby, nowhere to sit in the Lobby at the Disney Grand Hotel, no entertainment while standing in lines in the Park that lasted hours, etc., I know, operating Disneyland (when packed) with the highest levels of service is a management feat, but when I've visited the Park before, management always came through, performed brilliantly. But the attention to detail that always seemed to be the signature of Disneyland was just off this time. Just like in their recently released movie, Jungle Book, in which the boy, supposedly raised in the jungle, walks barefoot in the opening scenes like a city kid who has never walked barefoot much of anywhere, repelling slightly from pebbles and other impediments in his path. We went over to the California Adventure side to escape the crowds but same problems with lines on popular rides like the one at Radiator Springs that lasted more than two hours with possibly some of the worst background music to which I have ever been subjected. Nothing to look at amuse one self with while in line except some cactus and some bottles in the walls which, thankfully, people on the other side of the wall flashed their iphones behind to give the impression of mystery lights. When I was a kid, I remember taking the boat trip through the jungle in the main Park, and the lines were long, but the kids operating the ride seemed to have been junior comedians in training and kept cracking corny jokes which made the time in line seem to pass more quickly. But this time, in the long line rides, like the Toy Story ride, there was nothing to distract, just a mechanical Mr. Potato Head who occasionally said something. There was a kid cutting in line, apparently wanting to ride again without waiting, he told me, he had lost his babysitter, and his parents had told him to look for her in the line. He said this as he darted ahead, probably cutting the time waiting in this 90+ minute line, down to about five or ten minutes. (I expect to see him embroiled in the next Enron scandal in about ten years--a very slick operator for a 12 year old.)As crowded as the Park was, I couldn't help thinking that possibly the ticket pricing was off, or that Disneyland had sold too many annual passes and wasn't predicting well how many of the annual passholders would visit the park on any given day. Overall, it was just too crowded.\",\n",
       " \"...because it really is entirely magical. I don't care if it's expensive to get to, visit, stay nearby or eat there, or if the crowds are big & lines are long - it is still absolutely amazing!!! I first visited here 19 years ago & dreamed that one day I'd get to bring my future kids here - & it was every bit as amazing as I'd hoped. The whole family (mum, dad, 11 & 6 year old kids) enjoyed this place SO much :) My biggest 4 tips to visiting the parks would be: 1) stay at one of the Disneyland Hotels if you can - they really make the holiday perfect, are literally on the doorstep of the parks (so no stress with transport/parking etc), AND give you the early hour entry to boot. Awesome. 2) don't visit on a weekend or public/school holidays if you can help it. We were there mon-sat & it was busy enough on the weekdays, saturday was insane! 3) book in a character breakfast or dinner for your first day at the park. A bit expensive, but there is great food & you get a whole bunch of different Disney characters (different at each of the four restaurants, so read up on them to find your favourites!) who will walk around your tables, play with your kids, sign autograph books & take as many photos as you want. This will save you queuing in the park for up to an hour PER character (!!!!) - this is annoying & takes up valuable visiting time! 4) figure out & use the fast passes. I know everyone harps on about it on here, but they really are awesome once you figure out how to use them. We found that we all were much happier/patient if queuing only every second ride, & using fast passes in between where possible.Anyway, I hope everyone gets the chance to visit once in their lifetimes! We are already saving up to go back again in a few years once the new Star Wars area is open fully ;)\",\n",
       " \"Took my 7 year old son here for his birthday. We did a two day pass on a Sunday and Monday. The Sunday was insanely crowded because of something called Dapper Day. We only did a few rides. We grabbed a Splash Mountain fastpass and then hit Pirates of the Caribbean nearby (this line moved pretty fast). The ride was as fun as I remember it being. Not a lot of thrills (a few little dips) but fun. Then we hit Thunder Mountain. My son decided this was his favorite ride....until we hit Splash Mountain. He made Dad sit in the front and Dad is a bigger guy. We ended up getting completely soaked which I believe was because of the extra weight in the front. My son made me ride this ride with him 7 more times (the following day) and we sat in the front repeatedly and never got that wet. I really think the weight was the issue. I'm 135 and my hubby is probably a good 250 lbs. Anyway, we went from there to Indiana Jones and the ride wait was like 2+ hours long. We were going to possibly skip but then some people were kind enough to give us their fast passes because they changed their mind about going. We wish we would have too. My son kept his eyes shut and face towards the ground the entire ride. It was loud and bumpy. It literally just jostles you around and screams at you for three minutes. My son made me promise to never do that again. Haha. After that we decided to head out to Downtown Disney for dinner and get away from the crowds. The next day we started earlier and headed straight to Tomorrowland. I really wanted to have my son experience Star Wars and Space Mountain. I thought we'd grab fast passes and then head elsewhere. Despite it being a Monday and being early, Tommorowland was still packed. The Fast Pass was about 2 hours out which would have meant no other fast passes later. I decided we would grab a Space Mountain fast pass before dinner later in the evening so that we could burn off that time when we wouldn't be riding other rides anyway. We instead headed right back over to Splash Mountain. This is where my son decided he wanted to stay ALL DAY. We would grab a fast pass for Splash Mountain (only about a 30 minute wait), head over to Thunder Mountain in between(which didn't need a fast pass at all. The wait was like 10-15 minutes tops). We literally walked back and forth between these rides 7 times. He was happy with this. No long lines, the rides he had decided he liked and we didn't have too far a walk in between. I felt bad because I felt like he wasn't getting the full Disney experience but he didn't want to be where the crowds were so crazy. He was happy so I was happy. It's just SUPER expensive for tickets anymore so I had hoped he would make the most of it but to him, he did. It was fun but I don't know that we will be back anytime soon. Thank God for Fast Passes at least!\",\n",

Now, after 2 days, we'd not even achieved half of that. The magical hour is nothing like what it was. We spent half of it queuing to get in. I can't believe on their 60th anniversary, they are issuing tickets and taking security photos at the turnstile! Unbelievable. You used to do all the ticketing aspect at the ticket booth and the turnstile was a quick entrance into the park. There were rides closed for maintenance, the monorail, the Disney Train, Matterhorn and Steamboat which we were forewarned about on the app, but then several rides kept closing due to power issues - those being Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted House, Space Mountain. This meant a lot of people looking for something else to do, putting pressure on the other rides. That said, would we come back? Probably. We would give it a second chance in the hope that things have improved. Please just be prepared for a lot of long queues. Make the most of the fast passes (which ran out just after lunch). Enjoy the sights and sounds and smells that only Disney has and don't get your hopes up about how much you will achieve in a day.\",\n",
       " 'We had a great day at Disneyland Park! Wait times for rides were not bad, staff was friendly. Paint the Night Parade was awesome! Very crowded, to be expected.',\n",
       " 'Disneyland was a lot of fun. We took my son for his 3rd birthday and he had a blast. It was so crowded I think we were able to ride 8 or 9 kid rides the entire day.',\n",
       " \"I can't say enough good things about Disneyland's (Disney World's too) customer service. We visited Disneyland April 2016 for 3 days and we had a great trip until our last night there (April 23rd). The park was overly crowded, rides kept breaking down as we were about to get on them, and the firework show that we waited around for all night was canceled due to weather. This disappointment my wife and I very much, we have been to Disneyland several times and had never been disappointed when leaving so we sent an email to Disneyland customer service that night. We didn't hear back from them right away but when we did we offered a very generous compensation because our experience that last night. Disneyland isn't perfect but if you don't have the magical experience they offer they will make it up to you some way. We had a similar experience like this when we visited Disney World in 2015 and no surprise Disney made it up to us and all we had to do was contact their customer service.\",\n",
       " \"As a southern Californian I've been going to Disneyland since I was little, even worked there for a while, and I never tire of it. Yes, there will be crowds. Expect them; better still, plan to go in the off season. If you go at Christmas you'll be part of a mob and spend lots of time in line. Understand that a big part of Disneyland is soaking up the atmosphere and just appreciating the fact that you're there. Use FastPass wisely to cut some of the waiting time.It's really more fun without the kids! Parents, please know that your toddlers will not appreciate the park yet and may even be frightened by the life-size characters. Don't take them till they're four or five.\",\n",
       " 'As a \"WDW person\", I was really nervous going into Disneyland for the first time. I was afraid I was going to hate it because it was smaller with less to do, and much less vast than its Florida cousin. Or worse - I was afraid I was going to love it so much that I\\'d come back to Walt Disney World and hate everything. But neither of those things happened. What did happen - I gained a new appreciation for the parks in Florida that I\\'ve grown used to. I noticed how things were done differently in California. I got to see a completely new perspective on rides and characters that I thought I knew like the back of my hand. I didn\\'t come out of Disneyland underwhelmed or hating Disney World. I came out loving both of them for very different reasons. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to compare it to Walt Disney World because honestly, they\\'re very different places and both deserve to be appreciated in their own right. But I absolutely fell in love with Disneyland. It was so interesting to see the differences and feel the rich history of the park. It was very surreal to think that some of these attractions and places have remained mostly unchanged for the past 60 years - it\\'s just unreal. I was lucky to attend during the Diamond Celebration and I feel it was a great way to experience the park for the first time. It was amazing to see a park that so many people were so proud of. It\\'s just a different atmosphere than anything else I\\'ve experienced. Yes, it\\'s small, and can be crowded, and some rides were down when we visited - but for me it was all about the experience. As a person who likes to go go go on vacations, I was afraid we weren\\'t going to be able to do everything. But this vacation I was actually able to slow down and just take everything in, and it was amazing. There\\'s nothing quite like the experience of walking into a Disney park for the first time. It\\'s pure magic. And on my first trip to Disneyland (at the ripe old age of 23) I cried, I took it all in, and I felt the magic again.And I cant wait to go back <3',\n",
       " \"Since we were already in California we decided to visit Disneyland. Having been to Disney World multiple times, it left us somewhat disappointed. While smaller than Disney World, there were many attractions that were being refurbished or out of service for one reason or another. We still did enjoy our trip because it was Disney, but we didn't feel the magic and excitement we had hoped for. All in all, we thought $95.00 for a 1 day pass was not worth it.\",\n",
       " 'My wife and I have two children under three years old. Waiting in long lines does not sound fun to us. We went over labor day weekend on Saturday and Sunday after 5pm. We were able to ride most of the little kid rides in California Adventures with a very minimal wait. Our longest line was 15 minutes. I would highly suggest going in the evening. Make sure you download the app. It makes it easier to find the restrooms and it also lets you know the wait time on rides.',\n",
       " \"Personally I'm not a huge Disney fan so the thought of going to Orlando and being bombarded with hyperactive kids and hour long queues really gives me the fear so when we walked into Disney in Anaheim and it was quaint and calm I was so impressed. It's the original Disney park so it's quite compact but it has everything I would want from a Disney park. We visited on a week day and didn't have to wait more than 60 minutes for any ride, much less for 80%! We used the app to get around and plan our day and I have to say that made it a much more enjoyable experience. The only disappointment we had was that we visited in early September and that is considered 'off season' so the firework displays are only at weekends which means we didn't get to see them during our trip.\",\n",
       " 'We have never had a bad experience at Disneyland. Trip never seems to be long enough and too much time between trips.',\n",
       " 'As I expected, Disneyland was amazing! The Fastpass system is great and allowed us to skip long queues and spend more time exploring the shops, watching performances, meeting characters and trying all other rides. With the Fastpass system, the maximum amount of time I had to wait to hop on a ride was ~20 mins. The only downside was that due to weather conditions, they had to stop the fireworks display halfway through.',\n",
       " \"We regularly go to Disney World in Orlando, but this was our first trip to California. We're Disney fanatics and we had a fantastic time. Rides were awesome and updated, the food was fantastic and I didn't notice a huge price difference either. I would recommend more shaded areas, but that's not a deal breaker to me! Try the fruity pebbles donuts if you get a chance! We're already craving another trip!\",\n",
       " 'We were able to meet lots of characters for photos, the fireworks were amazing, Disney staff very attentive, great shopping, good rides queues not as long as Orlando park.',\n",
       " 'On our last day, several rides were broken on top of the 2 rides closed for refurbishment. Extremely frustrating.',\n",
       " 'We are from the Midwest so a trip to Disneyland was a much anticipated event. We have been to Disney World many times but this was our first visit as a family to Disneyland. We went to the park at opening which allowed us to be one of the first riders on several of the rides. My husband had the foresight to buy the max pass. Which made our wait times much less for the popular rides. We had pre-planned our lunch at Cafe Orleans. Our lunch was superb! The Monte Cristo was the best I had ever eaten. The service was very good and even though we were sitting outside we felt it was shaded and restful. We made sure to stop by the Tiki Room and grabbed a Dole Whip Float to enjoy during the show. Both are always a family favorite. The weather was perfect unlike the heat of Orlando, which made our day very comfortable. The highlight of our day was definately seeing our son meet and have his picture taken with Chewbacca at the Star Port in Tomorrowland. We all decided that Disneyland was a definite do-again on our bucket list of family fun!',\n",
       " 'Shoulder to shoulder, hot with minimal shade, lines too long to actually go on anything.After several dismissive interactions with staff the whole horrible weekend culminated in me sitting on a bench and crying, while passersby (and \"cast members\") pretended not to see me.I\\'ve never felt less valued as a customer. I wish we\\'d saved the money. I would never go back.',\n",
       " \"I feel there are more shops than rides in the park and you can tell that it's the first one I have been to Florida and found that the Disney park there was far superior to this it was ok a couple of the rides went fast I feel that this particular one has more geared up for young children then for couples also when we went some of the new attractions were not open despite having a schedule to say that they would be\",\n",

With our fastpass sitting all day to get on the cars ride in the late afternoon, we spent a lot of time in lines. After so many issues, I ended up counceling my 8 year old on how we need to just roll with things out of our control. However, since we paid over $400 for the day for our family, the number of these issues was really frustrating. I expect better from Disney. My kids wanted to go back to Disneyland and leave CA adventure. Soarin was definitely a highlight of the day and worth the hour + wait.',\n",
       " 'We visited the park two days ago and to be honest, we were very disappointed! This review is being made by three adults who went to the park instead of having kids with us so I know that could make a difference with this particular park. However, that being said, I have been to Disneyworld one time without kids and it is great fun for adults, too! So many things were under construction and they were the things that we would have enjoyed. The roller coaster was shut down as well as the Mickey Mouse Ferris Wheel. Also, there were two other attractions that were temporarily closed during the day. We were surprised to find that we were waiting in lines for 45 min. We did use the fast pass but you have to wait so much time in between each ride to schedule those. I know how crowded these parks get because I have been to Disneyworld three different times. However, this isn’t their busiest time of the year and; truthfully, the park isn’t that large and we really felt they should have had one pass for both parks. Possibly, if there were more rides available, there wouldn’t be these really long waits, We only were able to get on 6 rides/attractions in 6 hrs. and that was using a fast pass for 3 of them. We were staying in Laguna Beach and very sorry we wasted a day of vacation at the park.',\n",

       " 'We visited Disney California Adventure park last week on a week day and just for one day. Week days are value days. It was fairly expensive for just one day. My children were only interested in Cars Land. We did checkout the whole Park but never bothered with any other rides except in Cars Land. The big Micky Mouse wheel was closed which no-one informed us about. It was busy but not as busy as other times of the year I suspect. We had a really long day from 9am-8pm. We bought our tickets the day before when we ventured to Disney Downtown. When we arrived there were queues but they went very quickly. We got fast passes for the Cars Land Racers ride but even with them it worked out that we could only get on the ride twice in the whole day. We covered the other 2 rides as well which were all good. The best is definitely the racers, a real must do. The whole set up in Cars Land was amazing you felt like you were really there. The had different characters coming along all day as well. The food was unexpectedly no expensive and fairly good too. On the whole my boys loved it but as they inly wanted to see one area we just did the one day. I believe its much smaller than Disneyland in Florida? There are deals for 2 parks over 2 days look on the website although you can buy your tickets at the entrance for the same price I believe. So to sum up definitely worth a visit.',\n",

The water rider was the fastest moving line in the park as you came off drenched so pack a cheap plastic poncho in your bag for this ride ;-)You are allowed to take food/water into the park and i totally recommend you do this as you can snack and keep fuelled while waiting in the long lines.',\n",
       " 'It was surprising and disappointing that so many things were under construction or shut down. Of course you can check that ahead of time, but if your coming to Disney, of course your going to both parks. The Soarin ride was really good, and of course cars was too. With Ariel shut down, and too cold of weather for the raft ride, no roller coaster and no micky wheel, it seems that The value for the ticket just isn’t there. Plus it looks shabby to see construction, not magical like you want Disney to be. This has been our “go to” vacation spot for 4/7 years but we won’t be back now.',\n",
       " \"We spent three days here. The first was spent exploring. The second, we revisited our favorites from the first day and experienced a few new opportunities. The third day, we made sure to hit our favorites again before we left. We didn't need a fourth day, so I'm glad we didn't plan one. Several rides broke down after we'd waited in line for nearly an hour, which was extremely disappointing. However, if you have time, spread out your experience over several days so you don't experience the disappointment of a broken ride. The employees certainly work hard to keep things moving, but some of these things are just beyond their control. Whatever you do, BE SURE to enjoy the fireworks and electric parade at the end of at least one night. Both of these are worth the crowd and loss of sleep. You'll find everyone to be in good spirits, so it's worth the wait.\",\n",

I didn't know if my nose was my navel or my navel was my nose. i cried, screamed, then laughed till i hurt. This is not a ride for the faint hearted, or even strong hearts my struggle with this ride. I dont do ride, i did not know what it was, i am glad i went on to say i survived. now lets go to radiator springs, this was so like the movie it was the best. the Cars ride is so cool i went on it 8 times (single rider is the best). flo's cafe, the shops, the Cozy cone, luigis tyres. it was so very amazing. I have to say adventure park was my preferred out of the two lands (disney vs adventure) i spent 2 days here and i was smiling like a mad woman. my kids loved it too.the other happiest place on earth.its a must its amazing its perfect\",\n",

In saying all that it is really a wonderful place for the under 12s not so much for the older .

They help accommodate you getting on the ride. This park has rides like you'd find at a fair, then they have some thrill rides like the soon to be incredicoaster, the guardian of the galaxy, cars ride, and soarin. This is my kids favorite park of the two and it's easy to find things. The only down side is the backtracking to get to certain rides.\",\n",

Paradise pier is currently under construction making way for the new Pixar themed area.

Because of the Lunar New Year celebration we saw Mulan and Mushu and able to try some Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. The Disney Jr show is brand new with exciting character surprises!Currently in the mornings if you go see Anna and Elsa you can see Olaf and Kristoff at the same time. Check with a cast member for specific times.',\n",

Alternatively, just run for the ride and don't worry about a Fast Pass. Also, expect to line up for an hour or more, even with a fast pass. It's hard to not get stroppy when the fast pass queue is so slow moving and the kids start whinging, but then the ride was so much fun so I thought it was worthwhile. We didn't get many other rides in as the rollercoasters were all either on scheduled maintenance or broke down mid ride for 2 of the 4 days we were there. So the rides that were available had ridiculous wait times. Nevermind, back to Disneyland on the park hopper ticket.\",\n",

Soarin around the World is a very excellent quiet ride for all. Great theme park.',\n",

Food here is great make sure to get a corn dog, turkey leg and the most awesome smoothie down in the Hollywood area. If you like to shop California Adventure has that too and don't miss Soarin it's AWESOME.

California Screaming was by far are favourite ride! Adults are able to walk around the park with beer, margaritas and the like. The show at the theatre “ frozen “ was as good as it gets for theatre, what a great show for the kids. If you have little ones, then turtle talk is a great interactive experience for them. We will definitely be coming back such a great time!',\n",

And any Disney professional who takes your picture with any character or at any designated area you get all the pictures! Worth it! We got so many pictures. We loved this park. Cars land was awesome. I would suggest sharing food around the park. I also would suggest getting a fast pass right away for the racers. They go fast and the line gets long quick. When we were there and sounds like til April part of the pier was under construction for the up coming Toy Story land. So just to keep that in mind. The roller coaster and some of the rides were down. The Ferris wheel was also down when we went. Putting the disneland app on your phone is very helpful to get rides that are down and approximate rides times. Also where characters will be. Would also highly suggest seeing world of color! Great show! To make it easier and good seats for us we did the dining package. Was going to eat anyways.',\n",

We spent good money but we left feeling like we didn't get the experience we were expecting leaving feeling like we wanted more. Most of the rides were tailored to younger children. There should be a balance for older kids as well. The selection of food was not great on the California side as well. We found it hard to find something to settle with. Plus the prices at the park are crazy!! 80.00 for fries, burger and a pop for four people is a bit much.\",\n",
       " 'Typical Disney fun Great park. There when they opened with was the slowest part of the day. Cars and soaring are the two rides to go right to. Also recommended was the frozen show. FYI don’t bring a selfie stick in as they are not allowed.',\n",
       " 'This was a 3 generation holiday and everyone from 6 to 69 thoroughly enjoyed themselves. We took advantage of FastPass through the App and got to enjoy a lot of rides without the lineup. We took a locker outside the Adventure Park which was convenient for hopping back and forth between there and the original Disneyland.',\n",
       " 'So fun and another Disney must for families. There are rides and fun for all ages. This parkHas a lot more advanced rides. Cars land is amazing! Be prepared to wait a long time for some of the more popular rides (Radiator Springs & Guardians of the Galaxy). This last trip we took advantage using the MegaPass. That makes all the difference in waiting times, etc. California adventures is amazing!',\n",
       " 'We loved it here once again. We spent 3 days here and had a ball. We loved the new Guardians of the Galaxy section especially the dance off my 8 year old thought it was THE BEST EVER. Crowds were fine and the Lunar New Year section was fun.',\n",
       " 'I don’t think I’ll be returning to Disneyland as a planned family trip. If we did return, California Adventure is a better park. I’m not really impressed with either of the parks because they are both a ripoff. People who say their favorite place to vacation is Disneyland need to get out and see the world a bit more. Who in their right mind pays the price of admission to get in to this place to go stand in a long line for a subpar ride and then go eat food that’s overpriced and not very good?',\n",
       " \"Enjoyed our time. Glad we had a friend give us the rundown BEFORE going; explaining fast pass and recommended rides. Disappointed that a whole section was closed including Ferris Wheel and that whole area. I knew it would be closed but that and the Big water ride all being closed, it seems that Disney could have compensated us in some way. But hey, it's a Disney Park and that's just the way they rock. With so much closed, a partial day was good enough. Toy story ride was the best. Glad to see so many young people seeming to enjoy live theater with Frozen. Excellent. Staff very pleasant and Information at the front of Park was amazingly helpful. Water show worth the wait and standing on tired feet.\",\n",
       " 'Main Street is completely blocked off with a wall that makes it difficult to navigate with so many people. The park was super crowded but ride lines were not too long. We had a good time riding rides and shopping. Our favorite rides are Thunder Mountain Railroad and Space Mountain!',\n",

       " 'Honestly, there isn’t too much I can say regarding Disney that you wouldn’t already know. Such a wonderful place to spend time with your family. So much fun. The only thing I can add for those of you that don’t know, during the off season, it is really slow, but they’re are a decent amount of rides down for refurbishment. You can take a look at this ahead of time on Disney’s website though. I also do like the new Guardians Break Out remodel of the old Tower of Terror.',\n",
       " 'We visited DCA mid-week at the beginning of February and enjoyed the fact that it wasn’t as crowded as it’s neighbour Disneyland. We used the max pass to book fast passes for the two most popular rides - radiator springs and the guardians of the galaxy ride. Since we were travelling with our toddler, we used the rider switch option for both rides. The walkways are wider than Disneyland which aided in less people crammed into small spaces. However, due to the construction of the paradise pier area which will become a Pixar land a couple of months down the road, it felt like at least a quarter of the park was not in use. We enjoyed the shows and rides, but one day is definitely enough for this park. The only real negative event that happened was in the morning at the entrance gates. We arrived early and when it was our turn to enter, the parking attendant asked us how many tickets we had to scan. I said two. She glared at us and asked if our daughter was under three. We said yes, she’s 2.5. She then paused for awhile and sternly asked our daughter to stand up. She did and the attendant glared at her some more with a loud pout and glared at us. We then proceeded through the entrance gates. This unfortunate experience soured our entire morning as we were left thinking why this happened. Was it due to racism or the fact that our toddler is a tall girl for her age? Everyone else beside us was getting through the gates fine and we were never asked how old our daughter was otherwise. My husband and I concluded that it was completely fair of the entrance attendant to second guess our daughter’s age as she is indeed big for her age, but she could have simply asked us to show I.D. which would have efficiently solved any issue without making us feel like we were terrible parents trying to fraudulently usher our child through the gates without paying for her. All the evil glares and unprofessional tone of voice was entirely inappropriate. Hopefully, Disney will train their staff properly and also include some sensitivity training.',\n",
       " 'Left a full review for both parks on the Disneyland attraction. But in short, loved the park, but just wrong time of the year to visit. The big white coaster and Ferris wheel were closed!!! Bit disappointing when we travelled all the way from Australia (hence my 4 star rating) My hot tip would be to get a fast pass. The lines are ridiculously long 30-60min wait and this was low season!',\n",
       " \"I liked this park better than Disneyland - less crowded, newer rides, and lots of superhero characters. I especially liked it after sundown - Radiator Springs is beautiful at night! If you're coming from out of town and only have a day, definitely spring for the Max Pass. It lets you sign up for FastPasses from your smartphone while you're in line for other rides. It really does let you maximize your time in the park. I will say, I was disappointed to see so many rides closed - they're rebranding the entire Pier section and most of it was closed. So if you're traveling spring 2018, keep that in mind!\",\n",

       " 'We\\'ve always gone to Disney rather than Cal Adventure but my daughter and her friend felt like doing \"Thrilling rides\" this time. So we went oCalifornia Adventures for the first time. The food and snacks were quite underwhelming both at the Cocina Cucamonga, and the booths along the Festival Of Holidays street. It was a nice idea in theory to set up booths with different flavors from different cousins around the world, however the execution was not quite there at least for the snacks we tries. We did try several snacks, like the Brussel Sprouts with toppings, and the Chocolate Yule log, and unfortunately they all ended up in the trash after the first bite. The rides themselves were ok, the girls got fast passes for a few of them, however it was so inconvenient to walk miles between rides just to get a fast pass. And the most stupid thing of all????you couldn\\'t get a fast pass if you already had one for another ride scheduled. Well, you park Geniuses, we got one fast pass at 2 which required us to return at 7 PM. This means that you wasted 5 hours of our time in between, because we couldn\\'t get another fast pass. WE WERE PRISONERS OF LINES FOR THOSE 5 HOURS!!!!!!Then there was the Grizzly boat ride. Again, who are park genius engineers that decided it\\'s a brilliant idea for people to have to stretch their legs and bodies in acrobatic positions in order to get into the wobbly boats while the rotund platform is spinning Non-Stop??? They should be fired. Very unsafe and very inconvenient. The ride itself was ok for the most part, until we got slammed so hard and almost thrown off the boat if it weren\\'t for the seatbelts. I\\'ve been in 3 car accidents, where I got hit from behind, and none of that has given me whiplash or the bruises on my back that I got from being slammed back into the hard plastic seats of this ride. The park \"Geniuses\" need to pud padding to minimize the bruising impact of this ride. Next, we got on Racing Cars ride radiator springs, when the wait time showed 90 minutes. It actually ended up being 2 hours and 20 minutes because they had some type of malfunction and stopped the ride completely. We had been in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes by then, so we decided to wait. Very bad decision, it was a 2 and a half hours of PURE TORTURE listening to the most horrible CAT Screeching Banjo playing folk music or blue grass or whatever it is. Combined with the long line, and the bratty kids screaming and jumping every second like monkeys, this music was punishment of the highest caliber for an amusement park ride line. Couldn;t they at least play some country or even Christmas music like they did in the rest of the park?Then after over 1 hour at the Mickey Ferris wheel they tried to rush everybody through so we didn\\'t even get our own gondola. The only ride I had been looking forward to, and we got stuck with an Asian Dad and his kids who wouldn\\'t stop yapping for a minute, and keep asking us to take pictures of them. I didn\\'t pay $123 for the Cal Adventure ticket, to play photographer for the asian tourists.We will never, ever, ever, visit this park again, or bring any of our guests that visit annually from Europe, Australia, and Eastern USA. We will go to other places, like Disneyland, because every penny spent here was a waste and bad experience from 9 am to 9 PmWorst amusement park I have ever experienced and that is no Joke!!!!',\n",
       " 'Had a lot of fun for our first time to Disneyland. We are DISNEY WORLD passholders so we thought we would be disappointed by the size of the parks but we were actually pleasantly surprised and enjoyed both.

Can’t wait to see the new Incredibles roller coaster!The set up for and organization of the crowds for the night show were less than stellar. We were very excited to get tickets first thing in the morning so we could have a better shot at seeing the show this time. Unfortunately “world of color“ was still difficult to see with people shoved in here and there. The fact that it is a standing show means that adults stand up in front of small children. There really must be a better way!',\n",
       " 'An amazing park. Loved the world of colour show. Meet and greets with Groot, Sully, Loki, and more was awesome. Its smaller than Disneyland but we always start out with this park on our visits and then hit up Disneyland when we have a full day to get more out of it.',\n",
       " \"If we had known that the coaster, the ferris wheel and several other rides and areas were closed we wouldn't have wasted one of our day passes going here! Seriously, there should be signs or notices outside the park or when you buy tickets of what is closed. I understand a day closure but these are under full overhaul. Don't think we'll buy tickets for here again .\",\n",
       " \"It was the first time I came to Disney with a boyfriend. It was amazing going to California Adventure. Loved all the rides and the ride updates like Soaring over the world, Radar Springs racers and Guardians of the Galaxy. Margaritas on the pier were amazing!The clam chowder in the bowl was great too! I wish California Screamin was working and Grizzly River Run was also closed too.Frozen lemonade is a must! I didn't get my favorite chocolate frozen banana but maybe next time. Thanks Disney! I always have a great time!!!\",\n",

       " 'Although there are plenty of rides and attractions this does not feel like a normal theme park.Disney and others may spend a lot of time and money on gardens in their other parks but they still feel like gardens.This feels and looks more natural and rugged.There are good restaurants as well as snack foods and the boardwalk area separates beautifully from the mountain area which does have the feel of a mini national park such as John Muir or YosemiteThe night time firework show was very good and I would say has the edge on the one at epcot.The staff also seemed more helpful to people with disabilities which was slightly lacking in the 2 days spent at magic kingdom .Only my second visit but {I am looking forward to the next.',\n",

The park had just been decorated for Christmas so was quite festive! Lines for rides filled in quickly as the day went on, so it is imperative to get an early start. Restaurants were also crowded. Although the park was crowded, recommend visiting during the holiday season! These pictures were from a trip earlier in the year.',\n",
       " 'The frozen show alone is worth it. But I also enjoyed rides like guardian of the galaxy - it is a drop ride with a good story and video, and the little mermaid - the animatronics were amazing for that one. A bit smaller than Disneyland but I loved it still.',\n",

       " 'Similar to review for Disneyland. Excessive number of people let into park meant HUGE queues for food & rides (the Radiator Springs Racer ride had a regular 2-3 hour wait the two days we were in Anaheim). If we hadn’t had the one hour early opening opportunity from staying in hotel we would have been lucky to get more than 4 rides in a whole day.',\n",

This side of Disneyland is more about the older teens - with the rollercoaster 'Screamin'. The ferris wheel has two options - a stationery car or a swinging car - so all ages can go on. Definitely get a fastpass if you want to make the most of the rides.\",\n",
       " 'The great thing about CA Adventure is that they do serve adult beverages. Our family LOVES Disneyland and as the kids get older and want to be more independent this is the park we let them be a little more free. It is also a more grown up atmosphere from Disneyland. There is more for a family with kids and teens to enjoy together.',\n",
       " 'DCA is a wonderful change of pace from Disneyland. Still plenty of people, but it feels more spacious and comfortable to move around. Love the old Hollywood theming of much of it, and there is something there for all age groups. The Frozen stage show in the Hyperion Theater was amazing. I expected it to be a short show, but was rewarded with an hour of first class entertainment. Loved it so much we went back for the next show. There is much to enjoy here, and a great way to spend at least a day.',\n",

She had the whole boat laughing so hard. She really made that ride so much fun. The other was Helmer in California Adventure. He was working in the food area by Ghiradelli. He had a smile on his face and was not only just cleaning, but picking up trays and clearing tables from guests.

My fitbit did overtime. 36000 steps was nothing.Bought Christmas Disney ears and wore every day. We would have a good breakfast and then just water and an ice-cream for lunch and then go for dinner each night.The park was busy. School had just gone back that week in California, but with the passes we had it didn't matter. The early morning got us on 3 rides that normally have up to 65 minute wait.The fast pass, once you get the hang of it is incredible.Everybody needs to go to DISNEYLAND.

Walking can be fun because of the many highlights and festivities the park presents. The festival of international dishes made a new color and attraction. Just be careful wearing a hat or it might fly away while you're having fun in the Guardians of the Galaxy ride attraction. Sure enough my newly bought guardians of the Galaxy cap flew away from my head as the 'elevator' threw us up and down in our seats. The instant photo shot captured me still wearing it. We notified the staff, they searched for a while but nothing found. They suggested to make a formal notification at the park's gate. So we did. If found they will just send by mail. Up to now nothing arrived. Too sad.Overall it was a fun experience in DisneyCalifornia, as always!\",\n",

My main complaint is the Cars ride which is one of the best in this park is very unorganized when it come to the line. There is supposed to be a regular line and a line for fast pass/return time and all 3 times we have been to the park it has been a huge mess figuring out which line is which.

       " 'Arrived at the park entrance and was literally BLOWN away by the feel and love for Disney. Got our tickets and off we went. It was our HONEYMOON TRIP. First ride was Guardian of the Galaxy. Next ride was CARS.......OMG!!! The experience on both rides were absolutely more than AWESOME. WILL BE BACK.........ASAP. THANK YOU, DISNEY!!!!!',\n",
       " \"We had a park hopper and so were back and forth between parks easily as it was just my husband and I. This side has more thrill rides than Disneyland I would say and the MaxPass made this side so much better, especially for the photos. It was really hot when we were there and Grizzly Falls went down a few times, trying to get into Soarin Over the World proved challenging (we managed once in three days), but we managed most of the big rise at least once a day and the lines were practically nonexistent. The fastpasses go quickly on this side and often run out early afternoon for some rides. We decided to do Radiator Springs as single rider to maximize our other passes. The single rider line goes quickly and my husband and I wound up racing each other, which was fun! Hubby also liked this side because we could have a margarita, which helped with the heat! We also did the World of color dessert party the first day we were there. Our feet were sore by the end of day one, so we really appreciated having a seat to watch the Show! Plus, if you don't finish all your eats, you can take them with you. Two adult beverages per adult and a cup that syncs to the music for the kids. Great time overall! Highly recommend this...looking forward to seeing what they come up with for the new pier.\",\n",
       " 'I remember when this was Tower of Terror and it’s still Good! Fast passed it so was great to just walk straight in 2 hours later. We had a 2 day park hopper ticket well worthwhile. A lot less crowded than Disneyland. We saw the Frozen show probably one of the best shows I’ve been to and we got to a lot of shows. Musicals are our thing and the singing with the acting ( Olaf is a hoot) and then add in the special effects and kaboom awesome. Fantastic. We also went to the animation academy and cos we all like to try drawing that was really fun. Off the the page store is different and has an artist drawing there and is very interesting. Shopping of course.What can I say?',\n",
       " 'Being a long time Disney fan this park is disappointing. I and my children felt we much rather be at Disney. Not a huge amount of rides, most of it was down and just not the Disney magic you expect. I would skip it and just go across the way to Disney',\n",
       " \"Recently we visited California Adventure only to find out much if the park is closed due to renovations. If you have small kids then it's fine since Bugs Land & Cars Land are open but California Screaming is closed & you cannot walk around the entire boardwalk. The Park was really crowded the day we were there. We got a fast pass for the Toy Story Mania but when it was our time the ride was closed. Very frustrating! We did ride Radiator Springs but we rode single since it was a 2 hour wait if we rode together. We saw the Frozen Show in the Hyperion Theater. It was really good. We also saw The World of Color. That show is amazing & a must see. We were dancing & singing the whole time. It was a nice day so we ate outside at Boudin. The clam chowder was excellent. We also had a delicious churro & coffee at Starbucks. Starbucks is a nice place to decompress & enjoy some much needed caffeine.\",\n",
       " 'So many cool rides and things to do this place makes you feel like a kid again. I love theme parks and all the action and excitement that is packed into them. So much dreaming and imagination goes into every little aspect of this park',\n",
       " 'On the other side of the ticket concourse from Disneyland this park has some big and exciting rides. These include the roller coaster, the tower of terror(now a Guardian of the Galaxy) and the Ferris wheel with swinging cabs. It is Somewhat like Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Orlando. There are winery’s and bars. It is more adult oriented, but still lots of kid rides. Lots of dining options.',\n",
       " 'California Adventure is just an extension of the main Disneyland park, with different worlds, but all of the same excellent features.The rides were great. California Screamin\\' and the Cars coaster being my favourites. My friend and I had the multi-park pass, which was definitely the right thing to do, as you could go back and forth. If you stay at a Disney hotel, you also get the extra \"Magic Hour\" in the morning, where you can enter the parks before the masses arrive.Overall, just like the main park, things operated really smoothly, and the place was well-maintained.',\n",
       " \"Fun ride, parade, music, dancing, turkey leg, whats not to love. Oh yeah the line up, starts from the line up to park, then line up to search your belongings, line up to get into the front gate, line up for the rides. You spend pretty much 50% of your time lining up for things here. Please please get the fast pass, it is absolutely not worth lining up 2 hours for a 2 minute ride. if you get the fast pass the line up is probably less than 10 minutes, but I am not exactly sure how to get the fast pass. Believe you have to go to the ride and scan your pass and they will tell you to come back at a specific time. Other than the line up, the ride was fun and thrilling at the same time. The parade was a xmas parade for us and it was cool to watch. The turkey leg was a beast and it was tasty coming from a guy who doesn't like turkey that much.\",\n",
       " 'Fantastic, fantasy, and often just a great deal of action packed fun.playing second fiddle to the Magic Kingdom it just has to try harder. The Food and Wine festival is always terrific and the evening water and light show is great, just not as good as Fantasmic. Cars and Carsland is always a top notch attraction, nearly worth the price of admission to California Adventure. Soarin is always great, just remember to get a fast pass. Cars, just get into the single rider line as it moves very fast. The cafe near Soarin has good hamburgers and ribs, by Disney prices it is fairly affordable. Grizzly Rapids is best on a hot day. Overall a fun park. Not enough to do on its own. Best with a park hopper.',\n",

       " 'We went to California Adventure Park first thing (around 9am on a Wednesday) which was really good because the park wasn’t too crowded. We wanted to go on the main rides - mostly Guardians of the Galaxy, California Screamin’, Radiator Springs Racers, and Grizzly River Run. We went on all of these before lunch time, and even went on some twice because there were no lines. We got a fast pass to the Guardians ride, which was worth it cause we went on a lot of other rides while we were waiting. Tip 1: if you don’t mind going on a ride alone, go down the singles line to the Radiator Springs Racers. The wait was next to nothing and the ride is well worth going on.Tip 2: try and wear a plastic poncho or jacket when going on the Grizzly River Run as you will get wet. Highlight: Guardians of the galaxy - it was well worth the wait. Lowlight: some rides were down but it wasn’t that much of an impact. I definitely would visit again as the rides and atmosphere were well worth it. There’s also lots of stuff for kids to do as well and it’s very well designed for a fun day out. Make sure you walk around the whole park during the day, then again at night because you will see some awesome light displays that you do not catch during the day. It’s like a whole different park at night! We got the 2-day hopper pass which was a perfect amount of time for both parks for us :)',\n",
       " 'California Adventure was the least attractive park of the three (Disneyland and LEGOLAND were the other two) we visited during our vacation in California. We were me and my wife and just under three year old boy. In January a lot of the main rides are closed down due to offseason. For grown ups the only attractive ride was Guardians of the Galaxy. For the small boy there were 3 rides that were his taste mainly in Cars land. We were very disappointed that the playground was closed (trekking trail) not to mention a lot of the big rides for us grown ups. In Disneyland and California Adventure the crowds are just killing the experience. LEGOLAND at this time was empty and a lot of rides our boy loved. Maybe with teenagers it is much more worth it although I doubt it. Bad organization from Disney side as they need even with the fast pass system you have to spend most of the time waiting even on a weekday in mid January. Do not recommend spending time and money on this - you can get much more fun for the buck elsewhere.',\n",

       " 'Half the rides were closed (in terms of the good rides, two-thirds were closed!), with so much closed they should literally be discounted tickets. It was so pathetic. It also meant that the few rides that were open had hideously lines, even for Disney. Clearly they close a lot down after Christmas, I would not recommend going in January at all. However when you’re from Australia and only get certain time off work it’s not really in you’re hands when you can choose to go. DO NOT GO ON ‘GOOFYS SKY SCHOOL’ ROLLERCOASTER. THIS RIDE GAVE ME WHIPLASH AND BACK SPASMS. This ride is unsafe and awful. It’s zero fun, jerks you around and has all these horrible sudden stops that almost, or actually, give you whiplash. At the end of the ride we all said how horrible it was and then 30 minutes later my whole back and neck seized up and I was in agonising pain and couldn’t move. Had to leave Disney halfway through the day at 2.30. First aid weren’t very good and didn’t seem to be concerned at all at how severely dangerous one of the rides is. I’m a 27 year old fit and healthy female, this absolutely should not have happened.Before that happened, because there was barely anything to do, went to order a beer and my boyfriend and I (who are both 27) got refused even through we had ID because they wanted our passports (we’re Australian) — as if I’m going to bring my passport to Disneyland!!!! This is not the law, or normal practice in California. Plus the girl was extremely rude about it. Guardians of the Galaxy is good though, not enough warning of how intense it is and that loose items NEED to be held onto (sunglasses, Mouse ears, and bags were flying around)',\n",
       " 'This was my first time in this park. I have been to Disneyland plenty of times but this was my first time to California Adventure. I loved it! We knew going into our visit that a bunch of rides were going to be down – that is part of what happens when you go in January and its low season. While disappointing we knew that when we booked and we knew that would also mean the park would be less busy. We were right – the pier is currently under construction so be aware of that when planning. It’s going to be awesome when it’s done but right now it seems a little sad. But the rest of the park is awesome. I love the atmosphere. The rides are great. Its Disney I find you can’t be in the park and not be happy! Cars Land is probably my favorite part of the park. It’s like you are stepping into the movie.',\n",

Being adults there was really only the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the cars ride that were some kind of exciting. I'm assuming because some of the other rides were closed that made the lines for the ones that were open even longer. In future I hope they have the future closures announced further in advance.\",\n",

The rest of the stuff will be souvenirs like hats and shirts you will more than likely get for the memories. The fast pass is nice though not a necessity, but definitely nice if you are on a mission.The best advice I can give is to plan a few days of fun so that you can take your time and enjoy the atmosphere.',\n",

A bit of a combinationMickey's Fun Wheel was kind of unique with the gondolas on an inner track so it sort of rolls back and forth add a bit extra to the ride. The California Screamin' roller coaster was one of the longest and smoothest coaster rides around. There was much more diversity of entertainment options in this park than in Disneyland Park per se and I found it superior. Plan on spending at least a full day there (if not two).\",\n",
       " 'Family of 9 visiting after 2 days in Disneyland.Initially we were all sadly disappointed that the big attractions were closed due to maintenance as it is their non peak season. The big roller coaster is closed, the Mickey wheel is closed and the river run as well. I know they need repair and maintenance but it is just not the same feel.We all loved Cars Land!! Radiator springs was done so well. Every ride and store there was enjoyed by all of us. Guardians of the galaxy ride was the best there. Best to get a fast pass for this as the rides were very long. Also great rides for the non thrill seekers. Ariel’s ride and the monsters inc ride were great!',\n",
       " 'The early years were a bore. But this park with re-theming has hit its mark finally. It has its own interest to visit, and not just because of its older brother (Disneyland).The unique annual events, holiday theming, ect, really give you a reason to visit.They are going to probably add more Marvel, re-theme the Pier to Pixar.Most of what made this park a bore in the early years, is gone. The more recent additions are most welcome for repeat visits. Cars land, Mission Breakout, Christmas and Halloween theming, Soaring over America, Screamin (a real rollercoaster), World of Color water display at night, ect. Several great places to eat like Smokejumpers café.You have to visit.',\n",
       " \"Had a great time, but construction everywhere. All of Paradise pier is changing to Pixar Pier...lots of walls up. Other areas getting refurbishment too. With Max Pass it is easy to do everything in the park in one day. Did some rides like Soar in, Racer, Gaurdians 2 times each in one day. (Thank you spell check for continually changing the names of the rides to be incaorrect) We didn't understand why anyone would use the standby if fastpasses were available. Max Pass was worth the few extra dollars to save time...were able to do 17 rides.\",\n",
       " 'This was our first visit to California Adventure Park. Expectations High as we had read about it and waited for the day. Well the day came and we entered the park. We had planned the rides and the fast passes earlier in the hotel room and for the most part this worked well. The rides were great if you did not have to wait more than 45mins, but with the app I got, most rides by midday it was anywhere from 45mins to 2hrs wait time. Management of the park need to relaise that the place is overcrowded and not alot of free space as people always jostling and pushing to get by. Food seriously overpriced and the lines to get the food were impossible. I understand that this is a business overall, but it does somewhat dampen the day when the crowds are too much, food is expensive, wait times are ridiculous. It will be a long time before Iventure to California Adventure Park again. Sorry Management you need to look at how to operate a park better in the future.',\n",
       " \"As Annual Pass holder, I like to start out at the Adventure Park before going to Disneyland because it adds the extra umph in my step, and this is why...There is a nostalgic Hollywood feel upon entering...the upbeat swing dancing music that plays in the background, and the trolley filled with newspaper boys singing, then dancing in the streets make it oh-so-lively, and fun. Hollywoodland is a palm tree lined street which leads to my daughters favorite ride, Monsters Inc, and down the road to the Hyperion theater which features the dazzling live Frozen production.This is a great place to take those memorable photos on front of Mickey's Fun Wheel where I also enjoy eating at the the Lucky Fortune! I get their Thai Coconut Curry bowl on a bed of white rice...then I make a quick stop to Ghirardelli, where they hand out a free piece of chocolate...or, when I am feeling REALLY bad, I opt for their Nob Hill Chill...a Chocolicious shake that makes me super happy! Sweet toothers, take a look at their menu, its all amazing to me.The adorable Little Mermaid ride is here, and during the hot Spring/Summer days, we hang out at A Bug's Land, where the kids can get wet in the water play area...they love it. Don't forget the extra clothes, and shoes!! The kids are required to wear shoes/sandals in the water area, so pack accordingly...sometimes this is the highlight of her whole day!There is so much here that I have yet to explore...I recommend going to the simulated gliders in Soaring, to take your breath away - and The Bugs Life 3D show...to to widen your grins! It may be scary for the wee ones, but for the young and old, its a whole lotta fun!!\",\n",
       " \"Really enjoyed the Coco inspired Dia de Los Muertos display and mariachis playing. Park needs more rides and better ride placement. The few rides at the park are grouped close together so they are very crowded. Miss Alfredo's large bumper tires which have been replaced by dancing cars.

We went during peak season (Jan 4-6) and did not wait longer than 20- mins in any line thanks to Maxpass. Would recommend getting Maxpass!

They jacked up the ticket prices from $99 to $124 due to peak time. We had to wait 30 min just to buy tickets. They apparently can’t figure out they they shouldn’t be selling season passes at the regular ticket windows because they have to answer a ton of questions which slows down the line considerably. This was after waiting on another,one to have our bags searched.When we finally were able to enter the park, tickets in hand It was 10 am. I then immediately tried to get some fast passes for the Radiator Springs ride and guess what? They were for 9 pm !! How ridiculous that by 10 am they already sold out of all the daytime fast passes. So therefore, the stand by wait times for the popular rides was ranging from 1-2 hours. What might have help would have been if I purchased the max pass ( extra $10 per ticket) which allows you to access the fast pass tix on iPhone app, so I could have at least reserved the first tix before we left the hotel room. Still, they only let you use it once every two hours.We have three young kids, paid several hundred dollars for park tickets and actually only got to go on about 5 rides the entire day. The park was so crowded it was actually difficult to push a double stroller around without constantly bumping into people. It was a joke. God forbid there was an earthquake or fire, people would get trampled.Disney is clearly very very greedy, charged a 25% premium for tickets that day, let in twice the number of people they should have, they doesn’t give people access to the rides due to capacity constraints . We were super super disappointed. Shame on you Disney, we won’t be coming back soon and we will share our experience with all of our friends with kids. FYI we went to LEGO land yesterday and it was leagues more accessible and we had a much better time there.',\n",

The next morning we did the breakfast at Ariels Grotto and she was thrilled to see all the princesses. We had lunch at the Cathay Restaurant, which is a bit higher end and we appreciated the quiet, as part of the Frozen performance and it was great. Show was good and it was worth it to get in and seat ourselves before the throng rushed in.We had dinner at the the Trattoria as part of a package to see World of Color which paid off as they have a special area marked out for the diners and the kids had a great view of the show.\",\n",

It will save you much time.Plenty of places to eat and those suffering food intolerances are well catered for.The only downside is the crowds. Oih, it can get crowded.',\n",
       " \"This was my second time going to Disneyland parks for New Years, and also my birthday. The previous time I stayed in Disneyland to watch the fireworks and that was a nightmare. Wayyy too many people and took forever to get out. I heard a tip to go to California Adventures for New Years instead and was not disappointed. They have their own show where they usually have World of Color with fireworks and water tied to music. The crowd size was so much more manageable that alone would make it worth it for me. I'd suggest getting there 30-45 minutes before and snag a view at the railing by the pier. Also when the event is done you can turn around and watch the Disneyland fireworks.As for the park itself it is by far my 7 year old's favorite. She loves the swings, Mater's junkyard, Luigi's ride, Bugs land and Ariel's ride. My 10 year old prefers Disneyland since her favorite ride is Thunder Mountain Railroad. But they still have plenty of fun in both parks. The cars ride broke down a lot during our stay, but turned into our favor since we were there when it just got fixed and so the wait wasn't too bad. The revamped Guardians of the Galaxy ride is much improved over Tower of Terror since it still has the drops, but is more humorous. I'd also suggest getting the MaxiPass if you plan on getting a fastpass for the cars ride since you don't have to run to the kiosk to get them. As soon as you get in the park you can request them, but you still have to get them early. California screamer didn't have much of a wait and is still a fun coaster. And probably the best reason for going to California Adventure during the holidays is the seasonal kiosks spread around the park that sell different drinks. They were delicious and great for helping handle the crowds.\",\n",
       " 'I wanted to like this place, but I was nowhere near as impressed as I wanted to be. I definitely prefer Disneyland over this park. As a mid-50-year-old guy, it just didn’t seem like there was that much to do or rides I wanted to experience in this park. The two areas we spent the most time in and enjoyed the most were Hollywood Land and Cars Land. Radiator Gulch was definitely my favorite, as my two top rides were there - Radiator Springs Racers and Luigi’s Rollickin’ Roadsters, both of which we rode multiple times. I also loved the southwestern scenery with the mountains shaped like car fins, and how the nighttime lighting made it seem even more real. Hollywood Land reminded me of Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Florida, but on a much smaller scale. The animation building was a definite highlight, and I liked Mike & Scully to the Rescue and Mission: Breakout, although the latter was a little too jarring for one member of our party. Buena Vista Street as you entered the park just didn’t seem to hold as much interest as Disneyland’s Main Street USA. Bugs Land seemed like all kiddie rides, and the one thing I wanted to do there - “It’s Tough to Be a Bug” - was preempted into a Coco preview while we were there. Pacific Wharf was just a collection of shops and restaurants without any real rides or attractions. Because we’d gotten soaked the day before on Splash Mountain and the December day we visited this park was cold and windy, we avoided the Grizzly River Run, and Soarin’ Around the World had a two-hour wait and they were out of Fastpasses. Paradise Pier was another disappointment as the Season of Light presentation was shut down because of wind, and two other rides shut down after we had waited a while and were close to boarding - Mickey’s Fun Wheel (for a medical emergency), and Toy Story Midway Mania (for a mechanical issue), and we had to leave without getting on either. California Screamin’ looked cool, but I can’t do coasters with loop-the-loops, so that wasn’t an option. Ariel’s Undersea Adventure was good. This park did seem a little less busy than Disneyland had been the day before, but that may have been because of the weather. I’m glad I experienced it once, but California Adventure just didn’t hold the same kind of iconic attractions as Disneyland does.',\n",
       " 'The highlights in this park would have to be the Cars Radiator Springs ride. (The lines however are usually a minimum 1-2 hours.)\\nSoarin ride - flight simulator a must. Visit at night as well.',\n",
       " 'Great place for the family, young and old, brave and the not so brave. Got to slot in the musical fountain show that are on certain nights and I think also subject to weather conditions. Spectacular!!!',\n",
       " \"Our family of five were lucky enough to have their second visit to California Adventure Park. Crowds on New Years Day were not as busy as I had expected which was great, however we didn't get opportunity to get a fast-pass ticket for Radiator Springs Racer and with a 2 year old we didn't want to wait for 1.5 hours for a ride. We did get to go on quite a few other rides though including Mickey's Fun Wheel, which we have fond memories of from our last trip. Left park and returned in the evening for the light show.\",\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed our day at Disney's California. Everything was beautiful,. I highly recommend the maxx pass if your going on a moderate to high crowd day. Check online crowd calendars. The maxx pass will save you time from spending an hour or more in line for cars land or guardians of the galaxy.\",\n",
       " 'Sadly this is the first rating I have left that is not 5 stars and to be honest, my family was very underwhelmed. Perhaps the age of our children(8,14,16), may have played a part in our feeling disappointed.There are just not a large amount of rides at both parks, even combined. The waits and are huge for all the activities and the Cars ride was “temporarily closed” pretty much every day we were there.If your Australian, visit Movie World, Sea World and Dreamworld on the Gold Coast.I don’t recommend spending the money visiting Disneyland. The USA has so many other awesome places to visit, your time would be better spent elsewhere.',\n",
       " \"Great rides, the Gardians of the Galaxy Tower was our favorite. I wouldn't try to do both parks in one day. We got here at 7am and left at stumps (10pm). This park is aimed more for teens and up; faster rides, etc. There is still plentry for the little ones but you may want to check ride height requirements prior to going to save any disappointment. Disney staff are fantastic but stick to the rules.The laser light show is excellent.We had the fast pass thru the app which was heaps better than running all over the park to get them.There is food, lockers, strollers. They have it all. You just have to ask and you'll get the help you need.\",\n",
       " \"It was a great day spent by the whole family. On the day we went it wasn't too busy, so in hindsight, I really didn't need the maxi pass. My only issue was that, while we lined up to meet and take a photo with Spiderman, without any notice, him and his minder just up and left. Leaving the crowd confused then annoyed. Rides were great and so was the food.\",\n",
       " 'So hot yet so great for all ages, there is plenty of shade to walk around, take water, ice the race cars are fabulous for the grandchildrn. They loved under the sea, Ariel, Frozen, Pixcar, so many things to do, so little time',\n",
       " \"This park was the highlight of our disney trip. Less crowded. Better rides. Cleaner..more interesting. Many times rides went down which was disappointing but was still fun. Water show sucked and I wish we didn't bother. But we had fun.\",\n",
       " 'Much smaller than Florida Disney. You could probably do this park in a half day. We went during Christmas break so it was very busy and cost was more and lines where long. Park was clean and staff was friendly. Good for young children. Make sure you get there by 8:30am as getting to park will take a long time if you get there after 9am',\n",
       " 'I like street entertainment, Soaring and Grizzley - would like race cars if I could get on without waiting so long. Restaurants great.',\n",
       " \"We spent our first of three days at Disneyland Resort in that park and really enjoyed our day. Attractions are as great for younger kids or for adults, especially car's land, toy story and soaring around the world. It seems a bit less busy than Disneyland park, which was a big plus. The show Frozen is not to be missed, however the World of Color show is not as impressive as the Fantasmic show in Disneyland park.\",\n",
       " 'Travelled with 3 young kiddos- Wasn’t as busy as the main park. Radiator springs was awesome. Lots of food choices. Now serving alcoholic beverages throughout the park. Max pass was totally worth it.',\n",

Must Do 1) Radiator Springs Racers (everything in Carsland)2) Soarin around the world- Awesome3) California Screamin4) Toy Story5) Disney Junior Dance Party for Kids6) Animation Academy- Differnt experienceThe kids got to meet more characters in Disneyland California (Anna-Elsa, Sophia ...)',\n",
       " 'Adventure park is fun. You need a fast pass to move through the lines but the system needs improving, it’s not working well at all the way it’s currently set up and it also costs above and beyond your gate ticket price.',\n",
       " 'We enjoyed our time spent in this park although I was disappointed that “A Bug’s Life” had been preempted for an advance trailer of “Coco”. We had a good time wandering around the park with our son & his wife, but one day was enough for us. I would recommend that friends visit this park when they are in the area.',\n",
       " 'Been here several times since it opened. Loved that Disney paid homage to my home state and did it well! Rides a extremely fun and the themes of the lands are spot on. Only drawbacks are a lack of better food (However they do serve alcohol.....big plus!) and the rides are too spread out. Maybe they will be adding more attractions to it. That would make it even better!!',\n",
       " 'The park is clean, cast members are friendly and helpful. There are a lot of changes happening in the park lately. They added some fun things like cars land since our last visit. Wait times were high when we were there so I recommend using fast passes, possibly max pass if you can afford it.',\n",
       " 'Finally after many years I finally got to see this park. I had not been before and am glad I saw it before the big renovation to make the pier focused on Pixar. The park is fun and the rides are fun. There is plenty to do as well. My only disappointment was the world of color requiring a ticket.',\n",
       " 'We went here last month & had a fantastic time! Cars Land is just amazing! My 6 year old son loved it especially the Racers ride!! Just a great addition to Disneyland!!',\n",
       " \"We loved the park. Lots of walking but tons of fun. Gardians of the Galaxy was the best ride. Grisly Peak was cooler and beautiful. Don't miss the Festival of Holidays street food - from Indian to Greek...some really nice options\",\n",
       " \"So you've spent the day in Disneyland, now hop over to the other park. Grab yourself a hot dog first street turn left and it will be on your left. For Disney that is not a bad value. The ice cream is also good in this park. If you are still in Disneyland have a Mint Julep, alcohol free and very refreshing and clam chowder in a bread bowl. Avoid Pizza at all costs as it will be the worst you've ever tasted. I could lift the toppings off tomato paste and all as one piece. Costly crap. Now go on the log flume ride and if you go on at 8:30pm and it's quiet you can keep going on it. You will get wet, so bring spare clothes or wear a coat. The kids will love it. Alot of rides for all the family this side with the only big line being for the Cars ride which is worthwhile waiting for. California adventure closes before Disneyland so go back to Disneyland afterward and less lines there for the rides as well. Win Win :-)\",\n",

       " 'Visited Disney California Adventure park in December on a Saturday with a group of friends. The parking was well organized with plenty of buses to take you right to the park running constantly. The park was really magical to see.. I am only disappointed as the lines for rides were so long (approx 1.5 - 2 hours) so in a day I only went on four rides. The entry ticket was very expensive (especially after the Canadian dollar exchange) as well as all the food and drinks in the park. The cars ride and the California screams roller coaster were pretty fun!Don’t think I would ever visit again, even with children. Even though I visited six flags years prior I think I much prefer it!',\n",
       " \"It was our family of four's first time here. We loved our time in this park. Cars Land made us feel like we were on the set of 'Cars'. One of the Disney photographers was in front of Flo's Diner and took a family photo, that will be treasured. The Radiator Springs Racers was both the first and the last ride we went on--so fun! Be sure to download the 'Disney' App, so that you can download the pictures taken at Disney for free. They will be of a low resolution (5 MB or less) but you don't have to pay. You do have the option to order high resolution prints. California Screamin' is the roller coaster that will be shutting down and rebranded as PIXAR soon. It was very fast, and very fun! The World of Colour Show is in the Evenings, but tickets must be obtained (for free) early in the day, if you want a place to sit.\",\n",
       " 'Loved this park so much and can do it all in one day. The World of Color show at the end of the night was spectacular and the best way to end the night. Rode radiator racers and californian screamin twice, guardians, fun wheel, drew pluto at the animation studio. We did it all. Our favorite day of our vacation was our day spent here.',\n",
       " 'Disneyland is still a wonderful place to visit. The park is still clean, safe and a great place to visit. The baby strollers are out of control some seem larger than a small car. We enjoyed the afternoon Christmas parade. We visited the park on Thursday the first week of December we expected a smaller crowd at 11am the park was very full. Fast passes exceeded 6 hour return time and lines were 45-70 minute waits.',\n",
       " 'We had a max pass which we highly recommend. The staff was great even while having to work on Thanksgiving. The Frozen show was amazing however the structure of waiting in line and extremely unorganized to the point we were squeezed together in line and people were getting trampled. It was very nerve racking.',\n",
       " 'When I leave the parks in FL, I always tell people that \"nobody does it better than Disney.\" I didn\\'t feel quite the same after our experience in CA. Park was fun, no doubt. But I feel like everybody who works at the FL parks is much more engaged in their work. In CA, I felt like I was just at any old theme park. Rides are fun and food is pretty good, especially compared to other theme parks. But there\\'s still no comparison to Disney World which really is excellent.',\n",
       " 'Smaller park, not many attractions but still worthwhile to visit for one day. The best ride was Soaring Around the World. We didnt like Frozen, quite kiddish, fell asleep and we left early.',\n",

       " 'Great Disney day, use the fast passes to make the most of your day, especially for the cars and buzz rides. The World of colour show was great too, you can get a fast pass for a reserved viewing area throughout the day which saves a bit of waiting time for a good view of the show.',\n",
       " \"We love the vibe of DCA, for starters it was noticeably less crowded than Disneyland. The theming of each land was also more well done. Cars land was so beautiful, we came back later at night to see all the Christmas lights. My kids had a good time with the rides in Bug's land, I found the chew-chew train quite charming myself.We could not get enough of GoTG, while we were debating over which ride to take before leaving, a CM came up to help us decide. When he told us that there were 8 versions, that did it for us.Racers is so stunning to see at night, with the lights. While helping me with my RSR ride photo, the CM kindly informed us that we would get a better photo if the kids were seated at the back row.California Screaming is probably the most beautiful roller coaster I have even seen and the scariest ride award goes to Mickey's Death Wheel (take the sliding gondolas). Mater's Jamboree was also quite the riot.Groot does a little dance off and there's lots of little performances here and there. We spent more time at DCA than at DL. My kids are a little older and meet the minimum height and age requirement for all the rides so we had a thoroughly easier time. But there is parent switch available and they are very obliging so no reason why the adults can't enjoy themselves here :) the game stalls are also good fun, they're guaranteed wins.\",\n",
       " 'Since our last visit the TOT is no more and I approached its replacement, Mission Breakout Guardians of the Galaxy with trepidation. However from the first moment I entered the ride I knew my fears were groundless. The pre shows were brilliant in HD especially the animatronic Rocket. The ride is brilliant with random drops and lifts stopping at HD screens depicting scences of GOG with great music. Unfortunately the ride is over too soon but you leave the ride feeling exillerated and wanting to do it again again again and again which I did 6 times. Well done Disney great ride',\n",
       " 'It has been a very long time since I have been to Disney Land. This was my first visit to this new park. Mom had been with my sister a few years ago. We did not get into the Park until 2 PM. Mom, having been directed me as I pushed her wheel chair. We went to the Market section and watched them make sour dough bread. We then had some soup served in the bread bowl. We went to the \"Cars\" section. Many of the good rides had very long waits. We went on a dancing car ride. We went on the Monster\\'s ride and Souring across America ride. This was the best, and worth the wait. There were many people and it was a challenge trying to maneuver a wheel chair. Do to my poor night vision and the low light level. Once it got dark. I found it even more of a challenge to maneuver the wheel chair. We had a good time while we were there. But we had been up since early in the morning. So by 7:30 PM, we decided to go to Downtown Disney and get some dinner, then go to the hotel. Disney does go all out on their displays. I enjoyed the cactus garden as we watched the Lightning MaQueen race cars. I also liked the display of the older vehicles around the park. Watching the river ride. It would be better if you plan to spend several full days. We only got to spent two half days. When you consider you are paying $125 US dollars. When it converts to Canadian. It is expensive. Plus we had the wheel chair rental on top of that.',\n",

If you want high speed thrills, head over to California Screaming at Paradise Pier. And if you are truly an adrenaline junkie, then Guardians of the Galaxy is for you!! There are live shows, plenty of restaurants and wine bars catering yo even the pickiest of eaters. There is a sourdough bread factory here that offers free tours and samples, and a Ghirideli shop right across the way that offers free samples, chovolates for purchase, and the most delectable sundaes you've ever had. One of the most amazing shows you'll ever see occurs nightly: Worlds of Color. This park offers so much more variety than Disneyland. One day here is not enough!

We found that California Adventure had more enjoyable activities for their age segment compared to Disneyland Park. The kids really enjoyed the rides in the Bug's Life area. Radiator Springs was exciting, too, although some rides where a bit too fast for them. The Redwood Creek Challenge Trail was one of our favorite attractions. There were plenty of fun opportunities to take pictures and interact with Disney characters. If you have little Disney fans, the Junior Dance Party is definitely recommended! They will have a blast. The World of Color - Season of Light show in the evening was breathtaking and fascinating. You don't want to miss it. To get a good viewing spot get a fastpass for it early in the day.We arrived at opening time. The hour between 9 and 10am is great for enjoying rides by yourself with the little kids without any waits at all. We were able to do 8 rides in one hour!\",\n",

I have been to Disneyland anaheim (like 10 times), Disneyworld Florida, and Disneyland Hongkong but this is my first to California.We left early and bought fastpass in case the place was crowded. And it was. Using our fastpass, instead of waiting 25 min (later 75 min) for guardian of the galaxy we got inside in 10 minutes. And it was a tense, unexpected and FUN experience.The Hollywood park was not that much. They taught how to do sketches. We missed the Frozen in the Hyperion. maybe the best in that Hollywood area.The best may be the Soaring Around the world in the Grizzly bear area. The warning was ominous: suspended in air, speed move, not good for people with fear of height. We were not sure we wanted to go on something that will be dangerous to our heart.But it turned out to be soooooo relaxing and fun. Great job California. Another good thing is the restaurant. Many restaurants. Not cheap but truly tasty. The night was closed with festival of light in the water fountain. Beautiful, showing pieces of Disney movies under the wonderful water movement and lasted for 26 minutes.We left early, we used fastpass and we did not rest. But still when we left this park, we missed a few. I think we need 1.5 days to cover california.',\n",

Dinner reservations for Cathay Circle proved to be wise as a short line was developing outside the entry. Ordered prime rib. Compared to Steak House 55 Restaurant, we like the prime rib more at Steak House 55 and the potatoes augratin. But Cathay Circle management and staff were excellent. We managed to enjoy our prime rib dinners at Cathay Circle and loved the photographs on the entry way walls leading into the seating areas with the hostess explaining who the people in the photos were and their involvement with Walt Disney and his films. Very enlightening. Very special 31st anniversary as well. Quite and romantic evening dinner.',\n",

The best headline rides for kids are Radiator Springs and Toy Story but there are also some other rides that our 10 year old loved and we had to do each time we visited. As Australians we could get a 10 day pass (bought prior to travel in Australia) and this allowed us to spend a few hours each day in the park and not have to stay from opening to closing.

       " \"When I purchased Disneyland park hopper tickets, CA Adventure was an afterthought, a bonus we wouldn't really use. We came to CA Adventure the last two evenings of our 5 day Disney trip. When we first got here, my husband, my 2 kids and I were blown away. It is not inferior to Disneyland at all. From what I gathered, it is geared towards adults. We loved it. Ariel's adventure is abundant here. There's Triton's carousel, Ariel's ride, Ariel's Grotto (a restaurant), we loved all of it. Golden Zephyr and all the other rides were amazing. You definitely have to do the iconic Mickey Ferris wheel. It has two options, spinning and non-spinning. We chose the non-spinning as we had a big group of kids and older adults. This gives you such a great view of the park, and if it's evening, then the view is even cooler. It is huge, so we did manage to forget where we parked our stroller one time. We walked so much trying to find it that we stumbled upon adventures galore. We got to meet Princess Anna because w happened to be there searching for our stroller. We got to Bug's land because we were searching for our stroller there. Anyways, it was an adventure. If you are more of a planned adventure person, DO NOT forget where you park your stroller; it's easy to forget when you are having fun and easily distracted.We ate at Ariel's Grotto, watched World of Color with priority view. The next day, we watched World of Color again without priority view. Only thing to note is that, on days with World of Color (and maybe other events?), the rides on the waterside close early. So even though the park opens till 10pm, the rides bordering the water close early to prep for the show.Next time if I visit for 5 days, I'm giving this at least 2 whole days, maybe more. One regret is we didn't get to do Radiator Springs. That one is popular, so get on the line early or get a fastpass (if they have it). CA Adventure closes at 10pm versus 12am for Disneyland, so all is not lost. Just walk over to late night Disneyland adventure or Downtown Disney. I totally recommend Disney California Adventure Park!\",\n",
       " \"There weren't nearly as many rides as in the main park, and we ended up only staying for a few hours. The stores in the main street area were great, and the park was less crowded over all. The Ariel ride was really great! But overall, I'd skip it next time and just go to Disneyland.\",\n",

       " 'I downloaded the app & bought the Fastpass at usd$10 per pax. First time travelling to Los Angeles and we covered both Universal Studios and Disneyland Adventure Park during our 4 days in LA since my boys are 9 and 12 YO. Our last visit was 6 years ago to Hong Kong Disneyland, so we are not very familiar in many things. We only stepped into the park at 12pm, so the Fastpass helped quite a bit as we were able to secure the few must-do rides such as Grizzly River Run, Guardians of the Galaxy & Radiator Springs Racer without the hour wait and then plan the other shows and rides in between the Fastpasses. How do we decide which are the Must Do rides? The app shows the waiting time for each attractions, and based on the length of wait time, we could narrow down to the few popular ones (we are not going to do all anyway). The musical show of Frozen is highly recommended & is very impressive featuring amazing sets, stage effects and a very talented cast. Queuing up early for the show is a must for good seats. We were happy to rest our legs during the shows. Since we are there for the whole day using the app a lot, do bring along the power bank. Our mobile phones serve as a camera, a form of entertainment during the wait, helps us secure fast passes and inform us of the wait time for each attraction in real time.',\n",
       " 'They have great food for their holiday celebration! My wife and I loved the spiced apple cider with bourbon. Great aesthetic in the Main Street area but the park feels disjointed in theme. The wine country place for dinner is amazing as well. Great Italian food and atmosphere. The rides are just ok; I’d rather go to Disneyland for the rides and attractions. Otherwise great park and lots of great food options inside. We have passed and almost always come to this park to eat and then go back to Disneyland afterward.',\n",
       " \"We visited California Adventure after spending the previous day at Disneyland. We used the Max Pass for access to many rides with fast passes. We were able to go on California Screamin' three times. (This was a big deal because my daughter was scared to try this ride, but loved it once she went on.) We also hopped over to Disneyland for a few repeat rides and returned to finish our night at Radiator Springs. We ended the night on the Cars ride.\",\n",

       " 'Although line ups and wait times are to be expected, they seem a bit longer at DCA. Food at festival of holidays was great and reasonably priced, alcohol was WAY overpriced if you ask me!',\n",
       " \"This place is way too crowded. The lines are long and even if you get a fast pass that line is long - especially if the ride broke down and they have to make up time for all the fast pass holders. I know they can't control the crowds but it was difficult to even walk around. The Cast Members are very friendly and make you feel welcomed. This was my first time there and I won't be back again.\",\n",

The wind was blowing very hard that day so we were not able to see the world of color, but that was the only disappointment that day. we had a great time with my sons girlfriend as well as she had never been to this theme park and it was wonderful seeing the excitement every time she saw something new. we will come again as soon as possible.',\n",
       " \"This is an annual trip for us. We always like the rides in this park, but think they should have kept Soarin California based. As usual, the decorations this time of year really add to the ambiance and we really like the holly version of Carsland. Lines a bit crazy but Radiator Springs and a toy Story midway mania, but so worth it ( thanks to Maxpass ). The Guardians of the Galaxy re-imaging of Tower of Terror is amazing. Always thought the California Tower was lesser than the Florida Tower. A great addition to a wonder park that is so well done at holiday time. You can't go wrong\",\n",
       " 'I’ve visited DCA since it’s grand opening. The facilities are now maturing into a nice park, though the there here seems to remain highly commercial rather than experiential. Perhaps it is just the overpowering nature of the Hollywood district, food court, and Grand Californian as your initial environment when entering the park - other areas feel more recreational and less commercial. This too, like Disneyland, is executing very well and gives a good and consistent experience. It’s just not as storybook as DL.',\n",

We fast passed the Cars ride as soon as we got into the park and got a return time at 3pm. Rode several rides favorites of the day were the Toy Story ride and Cars. The new Guardian of The Galaxy ride may be best for kids over 7. People on ride (adults) screamed a lot more than the kids though! You can also single ride on Cars and Soaring to get through lines faster if you don’t have a group to ride with. The youngest age 3 really enjoyed Turtle talk with Crush and the interaction. Highlife of the park is definitely the many characters ! Look for times. We saw Spider-Man down Hollywood Blvd he really took his time and talked with the families. Be sure to get a cream cheese pretzel! This park does sell alcohol for 21 and up.',\n",

       " 'We visited DCA Park with our 1 year old. We weren\\'t sure how the day would go but it was FUN! We didn\\'t go on many \"adult\" rides, but we all had fun. We started the adventure by going to The Little Mermaid ride. Then we went to the Hyperion Theater around nap time but to our surprise the little one really enjoyed the show, though he (finally) fell asleep during the second half of the show. After nap time, we spent quite some time at the bug\\'s land. We also went to carsland to take a look around. The baby also loved riding on the carousel though it was his first time. It was a bit cold esp at carsland in the evening (very windy). Overall, we truly enjoyed the whole day at the park.',\n",
       " \"It's definitely one of the happiest places in California and will not forget my visit there. A wide variety of things to do for everyone to do together as a family. I suggest giving yourself a good day to spend in the park as there's a lot to see and do.\",\n",

       " 'I’ve been to California Adventure before, and this review isn’t specific to the park, but more so to the experience I had with the staff here. I feel like this is going to be my last visit to a Disney Park for a very long time, as I feel like the “Disney Magic” is all but gone. The quality of service is severely lacking compared to years past, and this is coming from someone who has vacationed at either Disneyland or Disney World at least twice a year for the last 10 years. I’ve been to Aulani, I’ve cruised with Disney, and now I’m just fed up with their total lack of decency in the way that they treat their customers. The problem for me started when I was in the park yesterday. Our family stopped for a photo op with Spiderman. We parked our stroller in the designated area and got in line. After my daughter got to talk to Spiderman and get her photo, we came back to the stroller to find one of our expensive contigo water bottles was missing. It’s a stainless steel water bottle that costs around $30. I was flabbergasted that someone would go into my stroller and steal something. It made me glad that I had my camera bag on my back so that none of those items were stolen. I spent at least the next 2 hours trying to think if maybe I had just misplaced it somewhere, I looked around for it, and I even starting looking at other people’s strollers to make sure no one had it. I was literally driving myself crazy over it, so I finally just called the lost and found to A) see if they had it, and B) just tell them to be on the lookout for it. The response I got from them was insane. They told me that even if someone were to turn it in, they would immediately throw it away…I said, you realize I’m not talking about a plastic water bottle, I’m talking about a stainless steel bottle, that isn’t just thrown away after one use. They responded by saying that for sanitary reasons, that’s their policy. They continued that it would be possible for them to give me a water bottle that looked the same in appearance as mine, but could very well be someone else’s. I told them my water bottle had distinct markings on it that I could identify it as my own. Didn’t matter. I then tried explaining to them you understand that if you give me the bottle, I’m assuming the liability of whatever could potentially be unsanitary about it, and that I would put it in the dishwasher. Didn’t care, no help at all. That’s not the Disney service I remember. Completely didn’t care that I had been robbed while in their park. So now the action I had taken to ease my mind about it, had just made me more upset then I already was. The came the evening, where we were trying to find a spot to watch the World of Color Show. I arrived to the area around 7:15pm for a 9pm showtime. My wife was on a ride, while I was watching our children. I thought I had found a good spot for the show, until about 15 minutes later, cast members came up to me and asked me to move, that they were setting up. When I asked what for, they said the World of Color show, to which I said, well yes, I’m here to see the show. They asked if I had a fast pass, to which I said no, and they told me I would not be allowed to stay in the area. The areas they told me I could be in, were areas, where you wouldn’t be able to see much if anything…The gist of what I found out was that unless you book some kind of preferred dining experience that combos with a fast pass to a viewing area, you’re out of luck on getting a decent spot to see the show. I felt like, I had paid a lot of money to be at the park, and I had arrived more than early enough to see the show, yet none of that mattered. The fast pass stuff has completely gotten out of hand, to where you can’t even experience something without one. I feel like Disney feels the need to gouge you every opportunity they get and for that I don’t have any desire to go back. You should have a fair chance to see a parade or show without having to pay extra and buy a dining experience to plan for it. Ridiculous. They treated me like a second rate person, like I didn’t matter to them, and for that they can say goodbye to my business. My experiences with them have been trending in this direction but this one did it in for me.',\n",
       " \"This park truly lives up to it's name. The rides featured are more recent (Guardian of the galaxy, Cars, Monster's Inc) compared to Disneyland park but the culture and feel of the place is exactly the same. I would come back 10 more times if i could. Be sure to be well hydrated as there would be a lot of queuing and walking as expected. I would recommend going for the fast passes if you intend to visit both parks in a single day but 2 days is definitely enough for both Disneyland park and Disney California Adventure Park. To maximize your time there, check out the parks closing hours on Disney's website as one park closes later then the other each day. So do plan properly if you intend to get the best of each park. and i highly recommend eating the huge turkey leg there. You can find it at the stall along the ferries wheel. You won't regret it and you can thank me later.\",\n",

Each time I have gone was in December and I got almost all the rides in. When you are there, do not miss World Of Color, a nighttime show, it is incredibly beautiful. But be sure to either get a fastness or arrive early. Also, do not miss Cars land. It is the most amazingly themed land and has the best ride ever, Radiator Springs Racers. However, if you do plan to ride it be sure to go early in the morning to get fast passes because they will be all gone before noon and the line is usually more than an hour long.',\n",

My son loved California Screamin' so much we went on it four times, consecutively! All in all we had a brilliant time and I am sure we will be back in the future!\",\n",

If they are going to take out Bugs Land, they need to make sure there are still kid rights for the family!',\n",
       " \"Disney California Adventure is every bit as charming as Disneyland except with a different flair. I also believe that they have better food choices all around than Disneyland Park. We ate the roasted chicken in Cars Land, it was delicious. And they serve alcohol. Not that I drink frequently, but it was nice to order a beer when it was 95 degrees out. I love the homage to California within the park and frankly, I was disappointed that they changed Soarin over California to Soarin over the World. It's still a fantastic ride, but I wish they had kept with their California theme there and just highlighted place. Overall, it's a 10 in my book.\",\n",

       " 'It was mine and my son’s first visit to Disney California Adventure Park. We decided to visit California Adventure Park the day prior to Disneyland due to the decreased operation hours of the park.Our visit was mid November and the Disney holidays had started! Highly recommend visiting during this special time, the Christmas festivities are well underway. The decorations are gorgeous and you really feel that Christmas is on the way. The park itself is fantastic! It’s very accessible and easy to navigate, especially with a pram (which I recommend with a toddler, as they won’t want to walk around all day - we averaged 25,000 each day at the parks which is more than any little feet can handle). The park is very parent friendly with stroller parking available at all the rides, plenty of bathrooms and parent facilities. There are so many toddler friendly rides - Bugs Land was great! My personal favorite was Cars Land - it was so realistic and authentic to the movie! I reverted to a child when I arrived there and felt that I was immersed in the experience. You could honestly spend a day in itself just wandering cars land and going on the rides over and over again. Recommendation - Pay the extra $10 per day and get the Disney Max Pass! It gives you access to Fast Passes via the app, which saves so much time and saves you from running around the park trying to get fast passes. It also gives you access to photo pass which was great! It meant we got professional photos all throughout the park which I was able to download straight from the app to my phone! Worth the money!',\n",

It is amazing, so much better than the old format and I loved that. It is so much fun, you see Rocket, there is music and the cast from the movie. There are 4 different versions of the ride so you don't know which one you would get. The rest of the park is fun, Calfornia Screamin' broke down, but that happens with rollercoasters and we got to ride a few times and the wait time was not long at all. There aren't that many rides at the park but it's not such a hard day of walking like Disneyland is. You only need one day here, I recommend 2 days for Disneyland.\",\n",

Broken down rides left and right, cast members short with visitors, and crowds like nobody's business! Although the newer rides are fun to enjoy (Mission Breakout, Carsland rides, Toy Story Midway Mania, The Little Mermaid ride, etc.), Disney needs to better control the crowds. Unfortunately that might come down to higher priced tickets, and restrictions on annual passes.\",\n",
       " \"Went to DCAP last week with my 3 year old as he is a massive Cars fan. We arrived about 30 minutes after opening with tickets we purchased at our hotel. This saved a lot of time. The park was busy overall but the ride lines were definitely not as bad as I was expecting. I was worried leading up to our trip thinking about waiting in long queues with a 3 year old but I think the longest we waited was maybe 15 minutes. There are also a lot of rides for small kids which was awesome.They really know how to get you as soon as you walk in. There was a girl selling bubble wands and other items and gave one to my son to try. Of course once I tried to give it back, he freaked so $22 later he had his own.There were quite a few food options throughout the park. I highly suggest bringing drinks and snacks, especially if you have small kids. It'll save you a tonne of money. We had lots of water and fruit as well which was great to snack on throughout the day.Radiator Springs area was amazing. My son went crazy once he saw Cruz and Mater and they even had a fun dance party in the street with DJ. He really enjoyed that.The one downer I will say is that the Radiator Springs Racers were closed that day and we did not know that until we got inside. This is a MAJOR draw to this park and I think we may have considered going on a different day if we knew it wasn't open. We were told it would be open the next day but we were only there for one day so I wish we would've know ahead of time. There are lots of characters hanging around the park. On this day we met Spiderman, Thor, Captain America, Princess Sophia, Goofy, Pluto, Mater, Cruz and DJ. We were told that the characters rotate throughout the days. A little bummed to not see Mickey or Lightening McQueen.Other than that, I would say that this is definitely worth the money. I didn't get to do things like this as a child so seeing my kid light up made it all worth it!!\",\n",
       " 'What use is a theme park when you have 1 to 2 hours to go on any rides. We managed only 1 so that at $124 per person that’s an expensive ride. The queues for food and drink were also long. I realise that we went 2 days before Thanksgiving but that’s no excuse really. The food offer looked junky and unhealthy. No attempt at modern options. And the ride we went on ? California Screamin. The very fast roller coaster. Of its type good. Recommended only if you find a Low attendance day',\n",

Adventures was great but it just seemed to have less to see and do with more congestion.

Still love little mermaid and soarin though. Guido's cars were like the teacups-don't eat first! Guardian's of the galaxy was fun. Saw the Frozen Musical Play and it was amazing and wonderful-totally worth it. Incredible what they can do-so talented!

Took some time to sort out the fast passes but essentially you are allowed one every two hours. Our daughter also enjoyed the outdoor redwood creek challenge with climbing and walking on ropes among tree houses, rock climbing and swings.

       " 'We were so lucky to get to see Dance Connection 2 perform here from Arizona. California adventure is a great place to go. The rides are fun, we didn’t have to much of a wait. California soaring is spectacular! It’s fairly expensive to get in $124 for a one day pass. You can also get bundled passes for each park. Definitely a must.',\n",
       " 'A fun park to enjoy for both families & couples. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there seems to be a lot more walking than Disneyland. Also get your fast passes for Toy Story Mania & Cars Land Racers. California Screaming Roller coaster is fun also',\n",

       " 'we thought the park was very well themed especially in contrast to other Disney Hollywood parks in the US and Paris. Enjoyed the rollercoasters, do fast pass the cars ride as soon as you arrive (it’s by the entrance). Enjoyed the screaming ride at night too. Stayed near so we could walk in. Had a 3 day park hopper ticket and spent 1 day in each park then went back to re do some rides',\n",
       " 'Several food trucks to dine at. I loved, loved, loved Tower of Terror and super sad to see it go but Guardians of the Galaxy was surprisingly FUN!!!',\n",
       " \"Having been here a few times it's still like a new experience each time. Too many favourite rides to list and particularly like the spacious feel, not over crowded. Grizzly River Ride is fun every time but if you plan on riding it after the sun goes down take a light waterproof coat/jacket as you will get wet and it's very cold afterwards. Each park are great in their own way but this park was probably better for older children and not as crowded. Pacific Wharf Cafe offers a few good options for dinner with plenty of seating. The colour show and fireworks at the end of the evening are definitely worth waiting for but getting a good view point is a little tricky.\",\n",
       " \"I personally love Disneyland. It's just the kind of place where you feel... happy. I'm 27 years old sometimes I go without my kids! Disneyland will forever be my second home and it never gets old.\",\n",
       " \"Perfect park for adults and older children. They have so many fun rides and I love the recently converted Tower of Terror to Guardians of the Galaxy. I was a big Tower of Terror lover and didn't think I'd like the Guardians ride as much but I was wrong! Loving the holiday festivities too! They serve alcohol at California Adventure and the Cove Bar was a big hit! My family will be back!\",\n",

       " \"We had park hopper tickets for CAP and DL. I'm glad we did if I had spent the full amount on just the one park I might have been disappointed. The cars ride was great, the monsters inc. ride was also fun for my son who does not love scary rides, my hubby went on guardians of the galaxy and said it was good also the screamer coaster but I didn't think it had enough great rides that could be done more than once considering the lineups to be worthy of the price if you could only do one park. We went back and forth and utilized the fast passes so we didn't have to stand in line much but I found CAP to be a lot of walking for not that much excitement. The souvenirs and food were super expensive, to be expected of course but still wince worthy to pay $6 for a coffee to keep you going or $4 for a cookie. We are Canadian so the exchange rate wasn't great, but we did have an excellent vacation, we did enjoy the Disneyland park more if you had to pick only one.\",\n",
       " 'This is a good place for older kids and adults to visit. Lots to see. The staff are very helpful and genuine. Good rides. The popcorn we had was great and a large one for only$4.50 which is great value. But at night when the sun is setting - the lights are incredible. It takes your breath away and seems to transport you to a different time. My son is 15 and he enjoyed it a little more than Disneyland. He said it was more to his age group. So that was a plus. Plus he loved playing all the games they have available.',\n",

       " 'There is not as much to do here as there’s is in Disneyland but pretty much all the rides and attractions are just as great. Most of it is geared for older kids, but Bugs Land is all smaller rides, maybe 4 or 5 rides here.On our last visit we went to Cars Land later in the day and they wait for the cars ride was so long we wouldn’t have made it before the Park closed. This time we went there first. It said 55 minute wait time on our first ride and we got in in 30. It said 65 minute wait time on our 2nd ride and got there in just under 40.We did Grizzly Peak next and went 3 times as the line stayed short in the morning. It was about 5 minutes each time and that is mostly walking time.Saw the Aladdin musical show at and it was amazing. The kids were really into it and it was great for my wife and I too. These shows are top notch.After lunch the lines started getting longer but still weren’t bad compared to Disneyland. We got on every ride the kids wanted to go on. They wanted to skip the coaster and the smallest ride in Bugs Land.The parade in the afternoon was great and like other things compared to Disneyland we went street side 5 minutes before the parade started and had front row seats.The only difficulty we had the whole visit was the kids having a hard time to see the World of Colour water show that night. We were at the front of the roped off section but their view was blocked by some of the adults in the VIP section. I could hold up my 7 year old for a while but the 10 year old was out of luck.And while I could accept these adults paid the VIP prices to get a better view of the show, I was upset when two couple in their 20s started making out in front of us to the slower Disney music. Saw a handful of makeout sessions throughout the park this day but i5 did get really bad during World of Colour.Regardless, despite that, California Adventure was a much more relaxed visit than Disneyland.',\n",
       " 'The park doesn’t have a ton or rides but it has great theming and a few really awesome rides. We love Toy Story Midway Mania and California Screamin. We did use Maxpass and were able to ride everything with basically no wait. It’s a great system. We also enjoyed just walking around and eating some of the snacks. We stopped at cozy cone motel several times for treats.',\n",
       " \"This Park has a lot on offer, this is the home of Califormia Screaming, Paradise Pier, the Big Wheel, Cars and many other attractions, we enjoyed many rides, my Grandaughters many more than myself, we also attended Ariels Lunch with the Princesses at Paradise Pier, the quality of the meal was excellent. Go into this Park, if you don't you would have missed something, it has a different feel to Disneyland.\",\n",
       " \"Not as crowded as the main Disneyland park. I would choose this one on a heavier crowd day of weekend as you are more likely to get the whole park done in one day. If you're a roller coaster fan California Screamin' is amazing and the single rider line allows you to ride it faster and more times than waiting in the standby line. Trust me you'll want to ride this more than once.\",\n",

       " \"At $10 a person, I was skeptical about the cost for the max pass for my entire party of 11. I'm so glad I listen to the advice of a friend, and tried the max pass out for one day. It was incredible! We were able to ride every major ride in Disney's California Adventure Park not once but twice! Toy Story Midway Mania, Radiator Springs Racers, the Marvel Tower, and many other fun rides including sorin, Grizzly River Rapids, California Screamin roller coaster and a whole lot more. With the max pass you are able to effortlessly secure Fastpass tickets right from your phone! Tap tap done! Another added bonus was the download of the PhotoPass that is included in the max pass. We typically stay in Disneyland anywhere between three and five days. With the purchase of one day of Max pass, I could easily reduce my total stay by one day and still get everything in. I highly recommend it! Just download the Disneyland app and everything can be done from your phone. Also, don't forget to book lunch or dinner at Ariel's Grotto, it is one of the restaurants that fills up fast and is always worth the visit. The food is great, and the princess experiences are not to be missed!\",\n",
       " 'We got a hopper Ticket for the two parks in Anaheim and out of the two (Disneyland and Disney California Adventure) we loved California Adventure the most! It is great if you prefer more rides, and personally I loved more in that park (eg. Cars Land, California Screamin’ , guardians of the galaxy, Water Rapids etc) I would definitely go to this park again and it was very entertaining!',\n",
       " 'Visited on Wednesday 8th of November and the park was not too busy. I went to guest services when I arrived at the park and got good advice to go straight to get a ticket for a viewing area for the night time show which was good advice. We arrived early at the park and managed to get on all the rides that we wanted. It has been about 10 years since I was here last and there have been improvements in the number of rides. Comparing this to Hollywood Studios in Florida I would say that California Adventure is much better. We did go to Disneyland on Friday and it was terrible so our visit to California Adventure was the Disney highlight.',\n",
       " 'My wife and I decided to visit since it was her birthday week and plus we wanted to experience the west coast version.......we are from Atlanta. Just to save a lot of trouble, I will say that this is a rare case where bigger is definitely better. Disney World in Florida gives you a better experience.',\n",
       " \"Getting better all the time. This is a beautiful park and I love the California theme. I really enjoyed the new version of Soarin' (not that there was anything wrong with the first version). Cars Land and Grizzly River Run are standout attractions. The park was surprisingly crowded for a weekday in November. We also underestimated the time needed to get through security.\",\n",
       " 'What can be told about Disney. It does not matter how old are you this place is just fantanstic. I just spend 2 day one on each park and we have a wonderfull time.

Since we last visited one of the US parks, things have changed DRAMATICALLY. The fast pass system as was, where you go to the ride in question and insert your park admission ticket, worked well. There were a limited number of fast passes available in each one hour slot and queues moved smoothly. Now, with the FP+ and tiered pre-booking, along with allowing far too many guests in the parks at one time, this is NOT an enjoyable experience. Queues of 3 hours plus because the fast pass queues were so long is not an experience I would wish to repeat. One of the rides was allowing only 4-6 'stand by' customers on at a time because every ride was 90% full of fast pass users. You can't even relax and sit watching the world go by in comfort because the crowds are so bad - you can't see anything. Shame on you Disney - sometimes change for the sake of change is not the way to go.\",\n",
       " \"the crowds were nt as bad as at Disney but it is really just a glorified fair, the cast members make themselves very scarce and you have to line up to see them, food is not good and there are one or two rides the your ones want to go on but other wise a big bust don't waste your money\",\n",

       " 'Disney have once again created a fabulous park, the Californian Screaming roller coaster is great and the queues never seem to be long for it which is a bonus. The Tower of Terror has had a recent refurbishment and is now a Guardians is the Galaxy attraction. We tried it out and really enjoyed it. It has a different sound track on each ride so it’s like a different party each time you go on it as the music is loud and thumping. During Halloween they have a monster themed version off it in the evening so get your fast past for it sorted early in the morning as they all get issued quickly',\n",

       " \"California Adventure offers a lot of rides for all ages and thrill levels. The California Screamin' roller coaster is pretty legit. The carnival section offers some standard rides but also some new variations. Cars Land is by far the best part of the park. It's like walking into the movie and being a part of Radiator Springs. The Cars ride is unexpected and our favorite ride for sure. The only downside is that the park wasn't as easy to get around in. We found that the signage within the park wasn't very clear and the main paths were narrow at many points. Other than that, it is a must-see when visiting Disneyland!\",\n",
       " \"We went to this park midweek in November and it was crowded. It was not near Thanksgiving so I was a little surprised. California Adventure is a really nice park but there seems to be less for little kids and more for teens. That doesn't mean you shouldn't go if you have little kids - it's still a great park for everyone.\",\n",
       " \"It's Disney. Go! If you have been to Disney World before but not to the two parks in California, one striking difference is proximity. Disney World is VERY spread out and it takes at least an hour to go from one park to another or from a park to lodging - even onsite Disney lodging. In CA the two parks touch each other and you can just walk there. There are very few onsite Disney lodging options in CA, but if you get one, you are there. Park hopping is a good value in CA.\",\n",

I have come to the conclusion that Disneyland is not for kids, or there should be an adult only day after spending hundreds of dollars to see the excitement in my Daughter’s eyes all I got was when can we go back to the hotel I’m bored again thanks to the long lines. So again how about a month of adults only so the lines are shorter and no parents having to watch the little ones with the stroller while the others have a blast...after the long line of course',\n",

No kids with us so fortunately we didn't really want to ride anything; just enjoy the atmosphere.\",\n",

There is just too much to see and do in a day and Id suggest maybe a day and a half in each park. We started each day about 9 am and so were too burn out to stay until 9.30 pm for the night shows. I had a GPS watch and both days it tracked 25+ kilometres traveled. Even taking out say 10km due to the rides, its alot of walking for little feet. Expect blisters and sore feet at the end of each day. I had to carry my children back to the hotel on the second day.One thing that is a must for both of these parks is to invest in the \"Fast Pass\" option. its only USD$10 extra per ticket per day. If you don\\'t get this, you can expect to spend up to 2 hours lining up just to get on one ride, not kidding! This place is understandably crowded and we went in the off season. There are people everywhere and the lines for each ride a huge. Theres a checkpoint before you even get to the Disney gates and after 8.30 a.m., the line here is huge. If you dont plan, you can spend 45 mins to an hour just lining up before you even walk into either of the Disney Parks.The food inside is a bit pricey but you are a captive audience and so have to pay what they ask. Overall, both parks are a great place for kids, little and big, to visit. Adults can find lots that will entertain them too.',\n",

Absolutely check out the vineyard across from cars land and go up the stairs to a special little known area where you can relax with the kids and there are not many people. Try the ghiradelli ice cream sundae too! The only down fall is it felt like the place was packed full. As full as it could get. The cars ride wait was over an hour, we were there 3 days and couldn't even get a fast pass to the Avenger ride. The wait went over TWO HOURS! It just felt like it was way too busy.

This alone can save you hours of waiting - the average wait time for these rides can be 60+mins!The Paradise Pier is about to get a massive makeover - to Pixar Pier - so it will be interesting to see what changes they make.You MUST get a fast pass for World of Colour - the night time show - it’s truly exceptional and there is nothing else like it!',\n",

When I visited, the Guardians of the Galaxy attraction was a few months from opening and sadly didn’t get to experience Hollywood: Tower of Terror, a disappointment because that was my favourite ride at Florida and it seems a loss, I’ve heard others have complained that the Guardians ride doesn’t fit with the Hollywood theme - I agree on that part.The rides that I went on were fantastic. I braved California Screamin’ twice and the Grizzly River Run was just as fun as Splash Mountain. A nice way to cool off on a hot day. There wasn’t as much to offer as Disneyland does, and managed to go on all the rides and spend a respectable amount of time at the park. Definitely worth a visit especially amongst groups of friends who are looking for a great day and adventure. Adventure is found here.',\n",

The next day we checked the wait times as we were passing by and at 9:00 the maxi passes were sold out for the day and wait time was 80 minutes, so plan to line up even for the rip off maxi pass.

At sunset when they normally turn in the neon signs and play Shaboom the song starts and then gets interrupted. The creepy crashed car by Lizzie's curio shop lights up and starts making noises, and other things are going on as well. Extremely well done. The rest of the park decor looks good also. The headless horseman on Carthay Circle is a great photo opp. It also lights up at night. I rode Guardians of the Galaxy at night and it was Rocket, Groot, and some fire-dog-demon thing. Very different from the daytime mission escape.\",\n",

       " \"My best advice as for Disneyland and all theme parks... Go early and power through some of the most popular rides early! We used this plan for both Disneylands, Universal Studios and Legoland and it worked at all of them. You can get fast passes throughout the day (free of charge) but there are restrictions and you have to wait certain times to get your next fast pass. Early in the day the lines are reasonably short and you can line up (or often walk straight on) instead of using a fast pass. My favourite rides here were the Lightning McQueen ride (because everyone can go on it, including my 5yr old and even nana was ok, it is fast at times but very smooth and lots of fun), and the Soaring Around the World was one of the coolest things ever, again very smooth, like parasailing over world sights like the pyramids. We had two days here and easily filled in the time, although we did go on our favourite rides twice. Also I'm not sure how often this happens, but the Cars ride was out of action all morning both days we visited, i still recommend getting a fast pass even if it is currently not operating, if it is not working when your fast pass time comes around, they will convert your fast pass so you can use it any time during the day, by the time it is up and running you will want a fast pass as the line got up to 2 hrs wait. Another suggestion... if you don't mind the heat, go on a really hot day... the first day we went was over 100F and the place was empty, we spoke with a few different locals who said they never saw so few people. Food options were also pretty good, same as in Disneyland there are some good healthy options, there is a kids power pack for about $6 with carrots, crackers, fruit, and drinks. Adult salads also very tasty. All up a very enjoyable visit!\",\n",
       " 'We went to California Adventure Park on a Monday. Found the crowds to be ok. My four year old found a lot of rides to go on here, and especially loved the rides on the boardwalk section. We watched AnaAnd Elsa at the Hyperion theatre, and then met them, which my daughter loved. Get the max passFor $10 so that you get some professional photos to keep for the day. I have some really good ones from the character meet and greets.',\n",
       " 'Radiator Springs Raceway is my favorite ride ever! I didn’t even enjoy the movie as much as I enjoyed the area and ride in this park! Can’t wait to visit again so I can explore more because I spent way too much time in Radiator Springs LOL I did get to ride a few of the other rides but the long lines definitely cut into it. The good thing is the surroundings are so amazing it gives you time to take in the details they put into everything...even the areas where you’re waiting in line! So much fun!!!',\n",
       " \"Don't know if it was that we went near Halloween but the lines were really long and by the time we got there most of the fast passes were gone. Some of the rides opened up after 10pm\",\n",

Children love the roller coaster “California Screamin.” If possible go for two day park hopper pass get there as early as possible, as by afternoon even with the Fass Pass the lines get too long – maybe 2 hours for one ride. The food was a bit expensive and the staff did their best in the hot weather.',\n",
       " 'So spacious rides quicker less wait time. Loved loved the town going back in time so cool 1960 era. More seating areas around rides shaded. I miss this place',\n",
       " 'It’s Disneyland, it’s great and well worth the money for a day out. Some of the rides are just fantastic... California screamer in the adventure park and Star Wars in Disneyland were highlights for us. The grounds are immaculate with more than sufficient restrooms and pit stops throughout. The only “but” is that Disney could learn a lot from universal in how to do fast pass access. It’s an unnecessarily complicated and inefficient system .. you either download the app or use stalls near the ride to forward book your fast track access but this has several irritations .. 1. You can only book one fast pass at a time, typically the time window is an hour and during that time you can’t book anything else (even if you are standing beside it), this also means if you want to book your place on a very popular ride like guardians of the galaxy which in our experience was 4 hours out from the time of booking your fast pass is effectively rendered pointless for that time as you can’t book a new ride until you take the current ride. Beyond that the app drains battery and the WiFi in the park isn’t sufficient so if you are roaming prepare to use data for the day. While the fast pass does help avoid the queues the system is just irritating and inefficient. Seeing the comparative offer in universal (front of line pass) in action shows how it can and should be done! This is the only reason for the 3 rather than 5 stars as it really did hamper the day at times.The photo offering through the app is a nice touch however and I still of course recommend going ... just not certain I would recommend forking out for fast pass it just doesn’t give the convenience you are paying so much extra for',\n",

       " 'We have been to Disney California Adventure several times. This time was special as we went with some of my husbands family of which two were young boys 11 and 8. Disney is so good at keeping the look of wonder and excitement on kids faces and they accomplished that more as we watch their parents become kids again. Always fun to watch that transformation!',\n",
       " 'We went here over Halloween weekend and had an amazing time. We got to ride several rides without any wait at all, multiple times in a row. This is only because we got there when it opened and utilized magic morning hours. The park got packed around noon, but by then we had ridden everything we wanted to, so we took a break and then went back. In some ways we enjoyed this park more than Disneyland because there were so many classic theme park rides for the little ones, and because there were so many places we were able to get our picture taken using MaxPass. Also, we finished the day with a glass of sangria/beer, which was nice as well.',\n",
       " \"I would have gone with 5 stars except for the attractions having technical difficulties after you have been standing in line. Both California Screamin' and Grizzly River Run went off line while we were standing in line. In my opinion, Disney should offer Fastpasses to guests who have now wasted time in line for an attraction that they will have to return to in order to experience. The park is clean, friendly cast members, good food, very attractive to see. The Halloween decorations were amazing.\",\n",
       " 'I know that the California Park is ranked #1 of things to do in Anaheim, but I do prefer Disneyland Park over California Adventures, but that is not to say I didn\\'t love this park, too. I absolutely love Soarin\\', Grizzly River Rapids, and Radiator Racers. I like this park because, to me, there isn\\'t as much that I am interested in, so it gives me more time to people watch. The best thing is Maxpass, because if you purchase it the second you walk into the park, you can get Fastpasses without having to walk to the actual attractions. Something to definitely do when it is very hot is ride Grizzly River Rapids. The signs say, \"you will or may get wet\" but let me tell you, you will get drenched. I even asked about it and Splash Mountain (in Disneyland) and the cast member said that they\\'ve altered the rides so everyone gets soaked. Good to know when it\\'s 95 degrees. Love the park and it was decorated nicely for Halloween. Carsland and the Guardians of the Galaxy areas were the most crowded and I am sad to see the Tower of Terror gone. The detail in Carsland is amazing. But don\\'t forget old time favorites like, \"It\\'s Tough to be a Bug\" as that still cracks me up all these years later!',\n",
       " \"Like Disneyland, its small, but it is an excellent place to experience the wonders of Disney. Being small you can see the whole thing in a day, and in October/November, wait times are short during the day. If you do nothing else, see the live stage show of Frozen. It's exceptional.\",\n",
       " \"What a great park, with rides for all the family. If you carefully plan your day and make best use of the fast pass, you may just avoid most of the lines like we did. Cars world and A bugs life world are just amazing - you feel you are in the cartoon. Radiator Springs Racing was a fantastic ride as was Soaring' across the world - just 2 of the rides that cant be missed.\",\n",
       " 'We went on Halloween and entered at 0900. Not crowed at all up til 1p (any way). We bought the Maxpass, a must from now on. It includes the photopass which was really awesome. We loved Frozen. It was delightfully funny, singing was great, the sets were amazing.',\n",

The place needs more shade though...more trees or umbrellas! It was hard on a 105 degree day but Grizzly rapids solved that issue!',\n",
       " 'Cannot wait to go back. One of my most favourite places to visit. Doesn\\'t matter what age I am I always enjoy myself. This side of Disney is also the more \"grown up\" side so you are able to enjoy a \"fun\" drink while in the park.',\n",
       " 'This park is a little quieter than the other one but it also offers less rides. You can easily do this park in one day! I recommend buying the $10 max pass for the day. Helps you skip majority of the line and get all the rides done. My sister and I did the world of color dessert dinning experience and it was amazing.',\n",
       " \"This park is sooooooo good! Possibly one of our new favourite parks. This was our first visit so everything felt so new to us, we've definitely got a soft spot for this park. It was super quiet when we visited so felt like we managed to take everything in and ride everything we wanted to/what was open. World of colour is possibly our favourite night time Disney show. Wow! We can't wait to return!\",\n",
       " 'First time here for Halloween - and it was FUN. The decorations were really great, and the way the Cars area was done was pretty darn great. Some menus are changed for the worse, so we skipped eating there and hopped back to Disneyland for dinner. Nice visit.',\n",
       " 'The kids loved the park. Our youngest who is 5 was able to go on almost all the rides. Make sure you use a fast pass for the color show! We didn’t know you need to ‘fast pass’ it to be able to watch it at night. Thankfully one of the attendants told us about it. It truly is an amazing show and all the kids loved it!:)Toy story was also a favorite. Get that ride done as soon as the park opens, it can be a long wait later on in the day.',\n",
       " 'It’s always great to go. I like to go with my little kids because the little rides and the characters mean more to them. Teenagers seem to be more bored with the rides at disneyland because they want more thrilling rides. It’s good to see so many activities and things to do and so many improvements on old rides.Change to cars land is nice and Soarin over the world is fun but I miss the california and the orange scent though. World of color has change and has more water and scenes. They have taken a few out. But overall it’s great!',\n",

We got up early, played hard, ate good food, laughed until tears rolled down pur faces and slept hard.We didnt ride any kiddie rides this time. We loved the new Galaxy Outbreak and Haunted Mansion! Halloween is the best time to go. But it is also busy because of the decor. Most lines were 25-75 minutes long. We downloaded the app to find the times for the rides. We also used the max passes so we could get fastpasses without having to go across the park for them.The cast members were all wonderful and friendly and happy. We enjoyed talking to them.Every single bathroom was clean and well kept. Cast members was constantly cleaning or picking up garbage or painting or talking to kids.That being said, there are lines for everything. Fastpasses are golden but even then, we stood in line for fastpasses and single riders line. Early hour days are worth it too.',\n",

My oldest boy loved the new Guardians of the Galaxy ride which I believe is the old tower of terror building. It was 105 degrees the day we went so we also rode the Grizzly Mountain water ride 3 times to cool off and my 6 year old loved it.\",\n",

       " \"We loved Disney's California Adventure. I feel it was designed for older people (teenagers upwards), and caters more for them than Disneyland. There are more crazy rides (like the upside down rollercoaster). However, there are still rides for children here. We loved all the attractions at the park, and had a really good day here. We walked about 25km in one day here so I would recommend comfy shoes. Would definitely come here again!\",\n",
       " 'I wish we got the 2 day Disney pass. We were limited with time and only had a 1 day pass + halloween pass which got us into both parks. We spent most our time at Disneyland and went over to Cali Adventure in the afternoon. We only were able to get through 3 rides due to the time spent in lines. Guardians of the Galaxy (so much fun), Rollercoaster (better than the ones in Disneyland) and Cars (extremely fun). This park has a different feel, not as Disney classic and caters well to teens and adults.',\n",
       " \"Yes, yes, all the rides are excellent. Loved them all. Yes, yes the food is expensive and very sweet for us Aussies.Took the anticlockwise route using my touringplans.com plan, but by the time I got to get the fast-pass for Guardians of the Galaxy they had run out at 11am, came back when they reopened at 2pm in a line half a mile long.Late at night 4 of us used the single rider line at radiator springs and waited for an hour rather than 2 hours in the normal line.Crowds were reasonable till Disneyland closed for Halloween at 6pm then that crowd hopped over and we were crushed.Although we got fastpass for World of Colour, the lack of seating and poor viewing made it difficult to see. We were in the blue area at 9pm and had to stand with everyone including young children on shoulders also blocking the view. Some of us got a better view in the wet area and didn't get wet! Message to Disney- A very poor effort- put in tiered seating!\",\n",
       " \"Had such a good time on rides that were not 50 years old. Just one suggestion...get rid of the Fast Pass. You're not doing the Disney Corporation any favors by overlooking Baby Boomers who are in need of a kind day at a theme park.\",\n",

Our favorite experiences were “Soaring Around the World” and “World of Color.” The food was delicious and there was many different types of offerings. “Mickey’s Fun Wheel” gave you a great view and we loved the show “Frozen.” We were very disappointed that we didn’t get to ride the “Radiator Springs” ride. We had a fast pass but it broke down right before we got on and never opened again that night. It had been broken down several other times that day as well so I would suggest riding it early before it quits. My husband and adult son loved the roller coaster “California Screamin.” We bought a single day pass for Disneyland and California Adventure. Although it was the cheapest offering, I would suggest buying a two day park hopper pass so that you can ride things that were broken down on the next day when you are at the other park. All in all, we had a great time!',\n",

We find there is less to do in this park than Disneyland, but the rides we enjoy at this park are some of our favorites. Cars Land is just amazing. It feels like you have literally stepped into the movie. And in this trip, it was decorated for Halloween and especially charming. Radiator Springs Racers is my favorite ride in all of Disney. My husband, daughter and son loved the new Guardians of the Galaxy ride. We all enjoy Toy Story Mania and Soarin. It was unseasonably hot while we were there, so Grizzly River Run was a welcome cool down. The World of Color show is stunning, and our favorite show at Disney. With the addition of Max Pass, we were able to hit every ride we wanted multiple times. Love this park and can’t wait to come back again one day!',\n",

This park has more experiences and shows and not as many rides but the few that are there are good. The Guardians of the Galaxy was really well done with the new theme. The Grizzly rapids ride is too short but Soarin is a favourite. Gotta love the Fast Passes. Clean and well themed like Disney always does.',\n",
       " 'The Adventure Park is much easier to get all the way through in one day than Disneyland. Not as much to do but we liked that. There were a few excellent rides (Cars and Guardians of the Galaxy) as well as a few little underrated gems. We loved the \"Soaring\" ride - really well done. We found the food options a bit limited but perhaps we needed to research other parts of the park??You must get the Fastpass or you wait up to 2 hours for the really good rides.',\n",

Expect lots of walking and walking and just feeling sticky and grubby at the end of the day (if its a hot day). Churros were famous and pretty expensive. Merchandise a little on the pricey side but its disney merchandise! The world of color water fountain show was amazing!!!

Also had the Maxipass for use with the Disney app. The Maxipass allows you to book a fastpass each hour from your mobile, even my foreign mobile using the wifi hot spots around the park.As this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for us, we used the Maxipass to go on all rides we wanted multiple times. The time in between rides wasnt used in lines but going on other rides or attractions. Guardians and the Cars ride get super busy so if you get the chance defiantly fastpass these rides.Maxipass/fastpass made the whole experience so much better especially with impatient children in tow. The park is seperated into several lands with rides and attractions in each. Our favourite was defiantly the Guardians of the GalaxyThere a tons of food and drink options all around the park and despite what I have read, the prices were not that bad.There are constant character street performances around the park that are well worth a watch.Heaps or stores and opportunities to purchase disney products.We arrived just before lunch and stayed about 8 hours until the kids were dead on their feet. Staff were super friendly and engaging.Great place to visit.',\n",
       " \"Man, I wish we'd stayed an extra day to do DCA twice!! The feel of this park is totally different from Disneyland and just as fun...More like a boardwalk amusement park. The layout is more condensed and has a better mix of rides for younger kids and more thrilling ones for bigger kids and adults. Did the princess breakfast, the food was ok but the service and one on one greetings from the princesses was worth the money. I highly recommend the MaxPass system and DO NOT miss out on the maxpasses for the more popular rides later in the day because they do run out! I can't wait to go back.\",\n",
       " 'I can’t get over the separation of the two parks, California Adventure and Disneyland. They are both on one property and really should be available for one price, in my opinion, because it doesn’t make sense to go to one and not the other. The parks are literally a basketball court or so apart from each other. Obviously they are separated for profit, it’s unfortunate that they are as expensive as they are so that more children and families aren’t able to enjoy them. California Adventure Park is worth the visit and extra ticket if you’re coming down to Disneyland. The park has a mixture of rides and attractions for grown up kids and adults as well as young children. The California park stays open later than Disneyland for the rides and for the musical fountain of color show.California park sells beer and wine to those of age at least one of their snack shops and also at their eateries/restaurants. They also sell the Disneyland merchandise at their multiple little shops. The Tower of Terror ride has been refashioned into the Guardians of the Galaxy ride, which is still a fun thrill and unfortunately has standard waits up to 3 hours - we didn’t wait as long because we paid the extra $10 for a fast pass and only went on it once. The wait for the Cars ride was also very long, but we were able to manage with the fast pass - it’s a fun ride and the talking moving car characters are so realistic, it’s very well done!The Screaming Rollercoaster was fun and stomach turning! Secure your stuff before it takes off! Yikes!What else can I say? For me, I might go again only when I have kids, but I’ll wait until they’re 7 or so. Maybe.',\n",

Be prepared to walk some uphill areas. Highly recommend this theme park!!!!',\n",
       " 'We found California Adventure Park to be the prefect addition to Disneyland. I actually could not separate which I prefer and would strongly recommend buying park hopper tickets if visiting the area. Park hopper tickets are great as you can then walk in and out of both parks as suits you throughout your time there.We also utilised the new Maxpass and managed to get on every major ride across both parks with little waiting. This, along with the free photo downloads, made the added cost well worth it. Carsland is all immersive and well worth a visit. Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot of fun with impressive details throughout. If you are wishing to stay and watch the World of Colour, be sure to grab a Fast Pass for this show by 10am or you may be out of luck. It is a show that is worth the effort. The colours, and the technology behind it, are truly impressive! This park does feel a little less crowded due to the wide, open spaces. There are also fewer rides and attractions here. It seems like there are plans to continue expanding this park over time. I personally can’t wait to see what they do next!',\n",
       " \"The park isn't much fun for people with a disability anymore. Disney used to have a fantastic guest assistance card scheme but they have done away with that, in the name of yet more profit. Now instead of the previous sensible system, you have to walk across each land to a desk, to request a time for your disabled child to go on each ride. You have to do this every single time you want to go on a ride! This is fine if your child isn't actually disabled but if they are, and are in pain/ finding the heat difficult/ fatigued etc, then you are forced to take them across each land and then back again to the ride.It's an absolutely absurd scheme and makes it incredibly difficult for parents with disabled children to access the rides and enjoy the day. The staff were also exceptionally uncaring too. They actually told me to leave my ill child all alone, so I could walk across each land to go to get the ride time!!  In the end, the only way we could make this system work, was to pay extra for another family member to come in to the park, in order to go to each desk to get a ride time. Maybe this is the whole purpose of the scheme - to make families with a disabled child pay for more tickets? As opposed to other theme parks where carers get in for free. Shame on you Disney.\",\n",
       " 'Both parks are amazing but we particularly enjoyed the Disney california adventure park, kids loved Carsland, we did too. Would definitely go back.

Additionally, the park has way to few (and to expensive, but that goes without saying) restaurant so that it was not even possible to get something to eat. 12 hours we spent here and we made 5 rides.

Guardians of The Galaxy ride (formerly Tower of Terror) always has long waits which can be overcome by Fastpass entry. Do not miss this one. Cars Land have a number of rides which should also not be missed. It is worth paying the upgraded $10 for a MaxPass, which, in addition to making Fastpass Choices much easier via your phone, provides you with unlimited free downloads of photos taken in the Park.

We miss Tower of Terror and wish they didn't change that story line, I mean, I love Groot and all, but we loved the classiness of the other storyline. A great time at the park was had by all!\",\n",
       " 'Lines were shorter here! Very fun place!\\nIt has a state fair appeal. Be prepared to stay on long lines.\\nCars and Soaring are definite rides to do.\\nThe Diva Marachi are great!\\nYou will not be disappointed!',\n",

       " 'Try the roller coaster at Paradise Park and Little\\nMermaid. To the right side of Disneyland.\\nIt’s very very good!',\n",
       " \"As per title, the California Adventure Park is the park to go. I do have a preamble, if you have been to a Disneyland (Magic Kingdom in Orlando) before, all other Disneylands are pretty much the same - I have been to Anaheim, Orlando, Hong Kong and Tokyo. IMHO, park hooper isn't worth it if you have been to another Disneyland before. California Adventure Park doesn't have a castle but the rides and the theme are different and make up for it. The animation academy, grizzly river run and radiator springs racers were my favourites. My daughter especially enjoyed her personal one-on-one with Elsa and Anna - it's at the Disney Animation ... the pictures were priceless. Get the Max Pass - you get both Fast Pass and Photo Pass. My only compliant is that both parks have limited WiFi hotspots - go figure. We also went to Universal Studios Hollywood and WiFi was excellent and everywhere. Of course if you have have two days, visiting both parks are ideal minus the park hooper.\",\n",
       " \"We had a great time! Cars Land is amazing! It did get very busy once the other park shut down for Mickey's Halloween party, which was unfortunate. Highly recommend this time of year, keeping that in mind.\",\n",
       " \"Adventure Park is so much fun, both parks are quite small compared to Disney World...but then again it's Disney Land and Disney California Adventure Park. Favorite ride by far was California Screamin' we fast passed the ride twice and probably would have kept doing it but those loops and small hills will make your stomach do waves. The swings were also fun, I do wish the ride was a little longer. The ride where you're in a round boat spinning and rafting reminded me of an almost identical ride at Silver Dollar City, Branson Missouri. The ride was exhilarating and perfect because we needed a cool down. If we return will definitely catch this ride again. Soarin' was decent, just like the one at Epcot but with less smells.\",\n",
       " 'Loved this place. Cars was my favorite place and racing cars was my favorite ride. The little kiddy side was just as fun',\n",
       " \"This is a nice park with a variety of rides. I wouldn't recommend going when it's hot. There is little shade, no fans, and the A/C is not very good. It has a classic theme park feel. There are rides for small kids there and big kids as well.\",\n",
       " 'Plan a morning and afternoon at this park location. Plenty to do with the kids. Entire facility is ADA accessible. Food service is good at all locations. All of the staff is Disney Friendly. Rides and attractions are great, expect long lines on the most popular.',\n",
       " 'We went here on our Wedding Anniversary and had a long but wonderful day. Highlights include Soarin, Screamin, Frozen, Midway Madness etc etc and we had a wonderful lunch at Wine Country Trattoria. The evening water show is wonderful (especially with Priority Seating) and the whole day was very special',\n",
       " \"We visited with our two kids (age 6 and 3) as part of our week-long spring break vacation in the LA area. We enjoyed Disney's California Adventure on two different days. Lunch at the winery place was excellent. Cars Land is the most impressive immersive area I've seen. Really felt like you were in Radiator Springs. The Luigi ride was one of my favorite rides at any Disney park. The Racers ride was as well. The Cars characters are out and about and in the evening the lighting and music was just magical for us and the kids. Great food options abound. We also enjoyed the Frozen musical, Soarin', and many other attractions. The pier area was fun and clean (interesting we were at Santa Monica pier earlier in the week and enjoyed that too but this was much cleaner!). Our 3 yr old won a huge Dumbo stuffed animal which is now a favorite memory of hers. The nighttime show here is absolutely spectacular. Standing room only is tough with small kids but we muscled through and really enjoyed it (we say it twice). Highly recommend this park, it is much improved since we were here a decade ago. Go to Cars Land first.\",\n",
       " 'Just a stones throw away from the main park is even more fun. This park has the rides for the older big kids and like Disneyland I love the old American feel to this park, the pier and Mickey wheel are so retro but amazing, cars land is well executed but would personally prefer toy story like Paris, loved what they’ve don’t to Hollywood tower of terror and the world of colour is a must but get your fast pass early in the day to get a good spot people start lining up for 2 hrs for this without the fast pass!',\n",
       " 'We always have a great time at this park. We always visit the Cove Bar for their drinks and lobster nachos before heading into the park. The line at the Cove Bar is always long, but well worth the wait. I will be coming back here!',\n",
       " \"We saved California Adventure for our last day at Disney and I'm so glad that we spent an entire day here! The Cars area is exciting and especially at night when all the neon lights light up the street. The Cars ride was also one of my favourites and I didn't expect that. Paradise Pier also has a lot to do and make sure you spend some of your day in the Grizzly Falls area... a nice woodsy place to cool down when it gets hot.\",\n",
       " \"One word, AMAZING!!! Go experience the Halloween magic at DCA, also don't forget to ride the GOTG after dark, its pretty awesome.\",\n",
       " \"Because restaurants were booked we were in food court. Several times...it's a free for all to get a table...you have to send someone for the table while you wait an hour in line to place an order. Between sour dough clam chiowder, Chinese and Mexican...,food was ok.\",\n",
       " \"Such a good Disney park! It was my first time visiting this park and I loved it. The queues were a lot longer here than in the other park so I would recommend using the fast passes (especially for Cars and guardians of the galaxy). Toy story midway mania is a really fun interactive ride and the california screamin' is AMAZING. Even if you don't like rides, there are lots of interactive and 3D rides so it's suitable for everyone. 10/10 would recommend.\",\n",
       " \"We went on a Thursday in late August and the queues were manageable, especially with fastpasses. Fast / Max pass - brilliant and worked very well for us. The 'max' part was an extra $10 per head (total cost) but included both parks in our two day hopper pass. You were able to use your fastpass via you mobile phone which saves you a lot of time and hassle. Any photos you have taken on rides / in the park are available to download for free also.Use your fastpasses wisely because Soarin' and Guardians of the Galaxy ran out! However we only had a single queue of 80 minutes (G of the G) all day so we could not complain.California Screaming and Radiator Springs Racers were family favourites and you should make sure that you ride them.A fantastic park that was probably out favourite over the three week California road trip. Well worth a visit.\",\n",
       " 'We did a lot more here than the last time we came. Single rider Cars Racers is the way to go. Rode three times in half an hour. No long lines for us now that the kids are older. Soaring Over the World was our favorite, liked it better than Soaring Over CA. Went to the Wine Trattoria for dinner and got a World of Color viewing pass. Expensive, but good food and close up viewing. Overall, had a great time!',\n",
       " 'We loved DCA. Cars land was our families personal favorite. If you go right at dusk they have a little party to turn the lights on and it was super fun to see. Definitely get a fast pass for the radiator springs racer ride - it was awesome.',\n",
       " 'This park is not as fun for us as Disneyland, but it is a close second. The rides and setup definitely have their own uniqueness to them in comparison to other Disney parks though! We rarely go anymore because we just always leave California Adventure wishing we had spent more time in Disneyland, or wishing we had skipped C.A all together. Still enjoyable though.',\n",
       " \"it wasn't the best. the lines were long and there was only a few rides that was worth it. However we did like the fast pass. the show were very good but long.they also turned off the good rides because off a little bit of smoke.  WOW\",\n",
       " 'So much to see, so much to do.It does give you a taste of California, from Santa Monica Pier, to San Francisco sour dough bread, and up to the wine country......and immerses you into a bit (or maybe a lot) of Hollywood and Disney magic. Since our last visit, Soarin\\' changed their venue from \"Pure California\" to around the World in 5 minutes..........Gone are the scents of orange blossoms, redwood forests and sagebrush. The new international scents include dusty grass over Africa, an ocean breeze over the South Pacific and roses over India. I liked the old scents better.Regardless, you can\\'t find this park in Florida.',\n",
       " \"We had a great visit with our granddaughter and there is plenty to keep us all busy. We loved having lunch at Ariel's Grotto and had the best seat in the house for the fountain and laser show at night. They keep adding new things that also keep you coming back for more. I added just a few photos but there is plenty of adventure for all ages in this park.\",\n",
       " 'Our party of 2 adults and 4 children really enjoyed our full day here, decided to go back to our hotel round 4 and back at the park at 6.30 staying till 10.30, we all enjoyed riding the big wheel at night and the light show',\n",
       " \"I totally recommend going to this park. I wasn't sure to go because I only saw cars as the only good thing but after going is so worth it. Just going to radiator springs is worth the park but they are so many good things. Toy story, the ferry wheel, sorin around the world, river and so much more!\",\n",
       " 'Get a park hopper ticket so worth it pop in and out from both parks. Went on a monday but still very crowded long queues but still had the time of my life.',\n",
       " \"Wow, what can I say - really loved this park. Loved this park and the Disneyland park but would probably say that surprisingly this edged it for me. The park has got a relaxed feel about it and doesn't feel as crowded as the other park as its a bit more spaced out. Best attractions for me had to be Toy Story Mania, Soarin and Radiator Springs Racers (which in particular really impressed me) - so well themed and a lot of fun. Didn't get chance to do Guardians of the Galaxy (previously Tower of Terror) as the Fastpasses had run out and the wait time was over an hour but I've heard that's really good too. We also did the Photopass and found there to be more photographers in this park than at Disneyland. All the cast members were really friendly and helpful as usual as well.The highlight for me has to be World of Color though, the night time show they do on the water in the Pacific Wharf area of the park. You can pick up Fastpass style tickets for it during the day (though these do run out). Ours were for the 'blue' area, it says get there for 8:30 we had a wander down just to see where the area was and they let us in at about 7:45, good thing as if we had waited till 8:30 we would not have got the great spot right at the front like we did. We were standing on the bridge which goes across towards the direction of California Screamin and this was an excellent spot so I'd recommend getting there early. The show was just incredible, so clever how it was done and sums up everything I love about Disney.Not a bad word to say about the park, we had a great time.\",\n",
       " 'The new Soaring Over the World is pretty awesome. They need to have one for the USA and one for the world though. Cars as always a lot of fun but always crowded too. Decorated for Halloween, it was fun. But we did see quite a few adult females that looked like hookers in their costumes, not really a good mix with the kids. And we observed a lot of folks with beer in hand getting in ride lines. Saw a few persons that were really intoxicated, never seen that before here. Seems the bar crowd has arrived at Calif Adventure Park.',\n",
       " 'This year we went for the Halloween event and this year was also the first time for California adventure carsland to be decorated.....super awesome! Between the two park I’d have to say California adventure is the park we would prefer going to more. My 4 year had more rides that he wanted to ride on and he especially loved playing the games on boardwalk. I think California has more kid friendly rides and shows likes the Disney Jr Dance Party for the younger ones unlike Disneyland Park. Plus it wasn’t as busy as it was at Disneyland park waiting in line for the rides or even shopping in the shops there.',\n",
       " 'Loved our day here too. Although smaller than Disneyland enjoyed just as much. CARS ride a must. Water colour night show fantastic. Great day to finish our Disneyland adventure',\n",
       " \"This park seems to be more geared up for older kids, but it's fun none the less. Little hotter here as there isn't as much shade.\",\n",
       " 'Saw some of the cutest and most original Halloween decorations in Cars Land and that made the whole trip worth it. The kids loved it and honestly so did the adults.',\n",
       " \"The Halloween decorations were wonderful. Night time was extra spooky. If your short on time use the Max Pass and Paper Fastpass. That's the only way we were able to ride some of the rides.\",\n",
       " 'The park was very nice. You can actually get a cold beer and a wonderful hotdog here. The Screaming rollercoaster was amazing.',\n",
       " \"This place has gotten better over the years. There's more to do and see and the rides are much better. The world of Color show is definitely worth seeing.\",\n",
       " 'I can\\'t say that Guardians of the Galaxy is MY favorite, but my husband is an entirely different person lol. He loved it so much, we went on twice, using our fast pass to get back on. The ride itself is perfectly terrifying in it\\'s drops, the music perfect, and the scenes that were made by the actors great. I really liked the \"showroom\".',\n",
       " 'The second day of a one day each park pass. It is now far more expensive that previously. Early entry is a great perk when one stays at the Disney Grand Californian. This is a great way to get onto some of the rides before the general public arrive and queue times run out to 60 or more than 120 minutes. Priority rides are Radiator Springs Racers which have a fast pass, Soarin\\' Over the World and Toy World. Unfortunately the latter was breaking down often, particularly in the evening where a short wait turned into more than a two hour one and then a number of the \"games\" screens were \"Oops, We are fixing something\" which meant the wait and eventual ride were frustrating non-events. The Frozen show is slow to start but once Olaf is on stage the whole tempo and enjoyment levels rose enormously. He was brilliant and was greatly appreciated by the entire audience - the laughter and applause clearly indicated this enormously. The shows and other rides were as previously. The Little Mermaid was not operating for much of the time and when it finally was the queue was excessively long and the wait time equally so. The website needs to be updated so the map is current.',\n",
       " 'Way too busy. The lines are just terrible. 210 mins to ride Galaxy of the Guardians. 180 mins for Radiator Springs. Even the not so popular rides had long waits.',\n",
       " \"This side of the Disneyland Resort is different in feel from the original park, but it is definitely worth experiencing. There are lots of things to see and do here (plus this park is generally far less crowded so you can see and do a lot more in a lot less time)!There are many things I would highly recommend while you are here, but first and foremost, I suggest you go see the live theatre production of Frozen! My sister wanted to go and see it and we decided to tag along in order to get out of the unusually high heat for September-and we were enormously impressed with this production! I just can't praise it enough! I very highly recommend (no matter the weather conditions outside) you go see it! I promise you won't be disappointed! Now on to the ride that I recommend everyone check out-Guardians of the Galaxy! This ride is awesome!!!! You'll want to hurry and get a fastpass here (fastpass station is right across from the ride) and save yourself a long, long wait in line. With the fastpass you'll still get to see all the fun details inside the building but you'll get to bypassing the long, boring wait outside in the heat. Now I should probably add that I loved the Tower of Terror, which was the original ride here. However, the new overhaul is just as good (if not even better), so no matter your stance on the original ride, you should make sure to ride this ride at least once so you can experience it's awesomeness. Plus, no matter where you sit on this ride, you'll have a great view!Speaking of view, here is should note-I recommend if you do Soarin' Over the World (which used to be Soarin' Over California-which I personally preferred)-you want to request to sit in the middle section and not on one of the sides. If you sit on a side, the places you are soaring over will appear very distorted (for instance from the side where I was seated the Eiffel Tower looked majorly curved because of the way the screen it's projected on is curved)-this really takes away from the experience. So, you've been warned-you want the middle section and the middle section only when soarin'!Now on to another of my suggestion while in this park-there are some great places to do pin trading here-so go do some pin trading! In fact, when you first enter the park there is a spinning wheel just outside one of the stores to your right. There you get to spin a wheel and whatever number it lands on you get the pin under the cup with the corresponding number (of course you are obligated to trade for a pin from your own lanyard to replace it). I recommend giving it a go, because I mean who doesn't like to take a chance spinning a wheel?!?! I got a really nice Anna (from Frozen) pin from my spin! Most of the stores here also have a pin board you can check out for pin trading. I found this park had a lot better pins on their boards than most of what I found in the other park.In this park you can also go to the Animation Academy and learn to draw a Disney character (they do a rotation of characters you can learn to draw, sometimes it's Mickey, sometimes Goofy, sometimes Pluto, etc). And in that same building you can also do a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa and Kristoff and Olaf (he isn't always there-but the rest of them appear to be). I did two meet and greets with them since Olaf wasn't there the first time my sister and I went. But on my second visit I got to get a nice warm hug from Olaf! This building is also a really nice place to just take a break from the heat-they play a loop of Disney clips that are really enjoyable to watch.Finally I recommend the free daily tour at the Carthay Circle (tour is every day @ 10:30am), here you can learn about the original Carthay Theatre that the restaurant was built to replicate. The Carthay Theatre is where the premiere for Walt Disney's first full length animated film, Snow White, was shown. The original theatre no longer exists, but this restaurant is built to replicate it in as much detail as possible. And the interior is pretty cool-so this tour is definitely worth checking out (especially since it's free and it's only about 15 minutes long). And if you decide you want to eat here too and don't have a reservation, go for an early lunch (they begin serving at 11:30am) and request a table. You have a much better chance that they can accommodate you without a reservation if you are just going at lunch time. However, if you want to eat dinner there-you will most likely need to make a reserve in advance to make sure you can get a seating!I am sure there are many other fun things I've missed in my suggestions above, but I would say from my list you get a pretty good idea of the variety of things on offers in this park. Because of this, I would recommend you give yourself at least a good long day just for this park (maybe even 2 good long days). I think you will be pleasantly surprised by everything you can find to do here!\",\n",
       " 'We visited in June last year and made use of the fast pass system, running all over the park to get passes. This year we used the App and the digital fast pass system which worked out brilliantly. We did all the rides we wanted with very little wait even when the standby was over 60 minutes. We did all the rides we wanted by 3pm, headed back to the hotel for a swim then back to the park around 6pm. It was magical coming at night. We booked a Magic of Color dinner with preferential viewing and enjoyed the meal and appreciated the spot for the show. A couple of final rides and we wandered back to the hotel just as the park was winding up. Magical day.',\n",
       " \"Disney California Adventure is like the big kid version of Disney. It seems to be skewed a little more towards older kids and the best part for adults is the BOOZE! You can't get alcohol at the Disneyland side but there are a few place in California Adventure where you can get a little pick me up.My favorite restaurant in the park is the Golden Vine Winery. You can make a reservation but they do take a card and will charge you $10 per person if you don't show. I've been to this restaurant a few times and each time the food and service has been great. There are also many different options for food throughout the park.My favorite ride is the Soaring Over The World. It's a mellow ride compared to some of the coasters but I just love see a few of the world's beautiful spots. I also really like the Guardians of the Galaxy. If you don't like the dropping feeling of roller coasters this probably won't be the ride for you. Grizzly River Run is fun but be prepared to get a little wet. California Screamin will be your ride if you like coasters. Radiator Springs Racers is also a fun ride especially if you have kiddos that like Cars. Wait times can get long during peak times so I suggest getting fast passes when you can or choosing which attractions you must go on and do those first.If you have the time I suggest sticking around for the World Of Color show at the end of the night. You can get a fast pass for seating but I can usually find a spot without one as well.Parking is easy to find and the staff has it pretty organized. The shuttles run often from the park to the lots so you don't have to wait too long.I love Disney so I'm sure I'll be back plenty of times in the coming years.\",\n",
       " 'We just returned from our trip to Disney. We wanted to go at Halloween to experience it at a time other than Summer. It has been about 10 years since our last visit to this park and it has improved immensely. The addition of Cars Land is a bonus! Our kids are older now so some of the board walk rides are a little \"kidish\" for them but they really enjoyed: California Screamin, Soarin and Grizzly Falls (be prepared to get wet). All in all we had a lot of fun in this park.',\n",
       " \"I go to California Adventure fairly often (I'm an Annual Passholder). But, this season (Fall 2017) has been awesome because Disney actually decorated the park for Halloween. Where the Christmas tree is normally located, they've placed a statue of the Headless Horseman. At night, the pumpkin he's holding as a head glows, and the eyes of the horse are an eerie red. There's quite a line to have your photo taken with the Horseman in the background. The overall theme is purple, and the trees in Radiator Springs glow brightly with twinkly, purple lights. The Radiator Springs area is completely converted for Halloween, yet with the typical automotive touch (pumpkins are created from car tires, there is a pumpkin patch of antifreeze bottles painted orange). Two of the attractions highlight Halloween music (Mater's Junkyard and Luigi's Tires). And, there is Halloween-themed food available throughout the park. I highly recommend visiting!\",\n",
       " \"We are a Disney fanatic family and try to go as often as we can, we absolutely love Disneyland for younger kids, the parks are not so far apart and they are not so big either, they have a very great vibe because they are smaller.

It is roughly 4 minutes long and they included many of the elements from the movie. If you are not using your MaxPass along with the FastPass, make sure you go get tickets immediately. We used our MaxPass as soon as we got in (8am) and our tickets were for 9:15am. Around maybe 1pm we logged back on for the Cars Ride and the next FastPass was at 11:20PM. It was at night so it was nice seeing it in different lighting.We went on a Friday, and Disney Land closed early for special Halloween tickets, so maybe there was some overflow into California Adventure.The Cars Ride is the top to top 2 rides in the park (Guardians of the Galaxy Ride is pretty popular).',\n",
       " 'Had a fun time, but the large attractions were shut down for several hours due to a power surge/disruption.The Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Breakout! was an absolute blast.

We visited during the Halloween Season for the party so the park was really busy with exceptionally long ride lines, not the best time to visit if you just want to ride the rides. The halloween parades and additonal shows were good with trick and treat stations dotted through out the park. We loved the cars ride we thought it was better than test track at Disney World. Everything was as you would expect from Disney, very good day.',\n",

She offered to go in and find us a fork since we didn’t have one on our tray with two meals. She also offered to pick up our tray when we were leaving. She had a smile on her face and she greeted guests while she was working. She was about the only cast member I noticed doing this all day long!

       " 'We actually enjoyed California adventure more than Disneyland. It wasn’t as busy and the layout was better. Also they have a Frozen broadway style play that the whole family loved and the new cars land was amazing',\n",
       " \"Our kids absolutely loved Disney California. There is so much detail, the park is clean, tidy and set out well. Cars land is amazing, it really feels like you have just walked into the movie. Radiator Springs racers is always busy, try and get a fast pass. World of Color is such a great show, we were truly inspired. Many of the popular rides have long wait lines (Guardians of the galaxy, Soarin' over California, Toy Story Blasters, Grizzly Bear Run) and if possible try and get a fast pass. There isn't as much choice for food compared to Disneyland and there isn't an option for refills. We packed snacks and ate out of the park. Afternoons get quite busy.We can't wait to visit again, we loved our trip and enjoyed the park. Staff are friendly, helpful and attentive. The park is also well set up for disability services.\",\n",
       " \"Must see....everything. Must do.....Soaring Around the World was awesome. Wanted to do the river rafting at Grizzly but the line was a 3 hour wait. (sad face) The waterfall was refreshing on a hot day. The play fountain was refreshing too. Cars Race was a must do for sure, so fun !! And must eat.... Smokejumper's Grill. I had to go back for seconds, it was so good.\",\n",
       " 'OMGoodness! What a blast and how convenient was the Disney App for Fast pass ordering and GPS to each ride location!!! The Paradise Pier had many good eats and places to rest awhile to break up the day. The World of Colors show was AMAZING! The Frozen show at the Hyperion was incredible also!!! We actually had a better day at this park than Disneyland Park the day before. Grizzly Peak was the BEST ❤️❤️ Make sure to get your free reservation to some shows like World of Colors, etc and meet & greets. It makes planning the day much more organized and easy. Staff even compensated us a duo fast pass when two rides shut down for a few to make sure we had an alternate ride to fill the time. Great service, quality rides and food. So pleased! Kiddos are still talking about how many characters they got to meet',\n",
       " \"I'm an AP at WDW and have visited Disneyland in the past; this was my first time at DCA. I have to say, I was blown away - it is an awesome park, fabulously laid out with so much more to do than I'd imagined. Not as crowded as the Florida parks, the CM's were friendlier and the park was cleaner. California Screamin' is now my all time favorite coaster and lines were never long - if you're willing to do single rider you can often walk on. Radiator Racers was my second favorite and again, worth the wait but if you do single rider, waits are much shorter. And whatever you do, don't miss World of Color - it's amazing. If they are doing two shows, wait and see the second one - no need for a Fast Pass and virtually crowd free.\",\n",
       " 'I plan to review other parts of California Adventure but thought I’d start here. As a little background, I visited Disneyland in the 3rd grade. That was back when they actually had tickets for the rides. We had to wisely choose which rides to enjoy as you were only allocated so many of each level. I assume this is where the phrase “E ticket ride” came from?Since that first visit I’ve not been back. I have, however, been to WDW 8 different times. I am a HUGE WDW fan and would go every year if I could. This year, however, we were destined for Southern California to take in some baseball, spend time at the beach and enjoy the beautiful weather. We were only able to fit in only one day to enjoy the magic of Disney. We debated long and hard whether it would be Disneyland or California Adventure. It was not an easy choice but in the end it came down to the fact we really wanted to see Cars Land. It also helped that the day we were there they had EMH which meant we could get in a bunch of rides with little or no wait.We had the good fortune of finding a decent deal on a couple nights at the Disneyland Hotel (more on that in another review) and are very happy that we stayed there as California traffic is even worse that I had thought.After an evening at Dodger Stadium we arrived late (after 12am) at our hotel. We were bound and determined to be at the gates for the park open so we dragged ourselves from our comfy beds and headed for the gate. The walk through Downtown Disney was very nice and pleasant. I loved the fact that security was outside DT Disney and not at the gate to the park. It was smooth and took no time. We arrived about 20 minutes prior to opening and were the 2nd group in line at our gate. While waiting our children (adult children) decided that they needed to caffeinate and could not wait for the park to open. They hustled back to the Starbucks in DTD which was a mistake. Had we hit on the way to the park it wouldn’t have a problem but the line had grown a bit by then and the service was s-l-o-w. They frantically scrambled back and arrived just as the gates opened…crisis averted.As the gates opened we quickly reviewed our fastpass plans and headed our separate ways. The plan was for two of us to hit Guardians of the galaxy for fast passes and the other to hit Toy Story. Then meet back at Radiator springs for our long awaited ride. Unfortunately the ride was not working. And here is our biggest disappointment of the day…the ride was up and down all day long. Thankfully the policy appears to be to allow anyone with a fast pass that has expired to go on at any time during the day if the ride was having trouble. I will say it was worth the wait, however, as this is a great ride. By far my favorite ride at the park.I apologize already as I feel as though I’m getting long winded and not helping much so let me try to sum things up:Rides/Activities: - Radiator Springs: maybe my favorite ride at any Disney Park- California Screamin: Love being able to ride a legit roller coaster; would like it if - WDW could add another (besides Everest) to WDW- Guardians: Good ride but does not hold a candle to Tower of Terror at DHS- Toy Story: Love this ride; worth almost any wait- Animation Academy: I can’t draw; I admit it. But I LOVE this attraction and was so disappointed when it was removed from WDW. This is a must visit for any family that has children old enough to sit and listen. We have four Mickey’s hanging on our wall at home that we had framed from a trip to WDW. You won’t be disappointed. Only advice to Disney…offer a tube for sale so your masterpiece doesn’t get smashed on its return trip home.- Soarin: Again, good, but did not feel quite the same as WDW- World of Color: I enjoyed this but we made one huge mistake. We did not arrive early enough to get a good viewing spot and that makes all the difference. It was extremely disorganized and not clear when you could get in. We had fast passes but it seemed like they let people in far in advance of the time indicated. If I go again (which I most likely will) I’ll be sure to get there earlier for this or maybe go to the later show (we went to the 9pm) as I understand it’s less crowed most nights.OtherWe hung out in Cars Land around dusk to watch the lights come on. It’s an impressive place during the day but every more so at night with all the neon. While there be sure to check out Flo’s café for breakfast. The food was absolutely outstanding and portions just right.Overall I really enjoyed California Adventure. It had some of the feel of Disney but not quite the same amount of “magic”. I do believe part of this was that I was not totally immersed in the Disney experience as we were there for just one day and most often when heading to WDW it’s 5 days in the parks and staying on property. I will be back and will most likely stay at least a few days and enjoy what both parks have to offer.',\n",
       " 'Love the Soaring attraction. You can also relax with a glass of wine and fine Italian food at the Terra e',\n",
       " 'Enjoyed our first trip to Disneyland/California Adventures this past weekend and we had a blast! Being the beginning of October, the crowds were not like they would normally be at other times, so wait times were short by our expectations. Cars Land is definitely my favorite area of California Adventures! Facilities are strategically located throughout the park, which makes it nice when they are needed....and they are kept very clean! I wish they had more water bottle filling stations around, though they did have water fountains at the restroom entrances, which was helpful. World of Color show was AWESOME!!! A great way to end our first day at the park! Will definitely go again, I want to see how they decorate for Christmas!',\n",
       " \"DCA has always had a special place in my heart as it opened on my 16th birthday. However, when it opened, it wasn't much of a park. Over the years it has gone through many changes and grown significantly. In the early years of the park, I went every year. But when I moved to the east coast (working at WDW) Disneyworld became my home park(s) and I only make it back every few years. The good, Cars Land is amazing (only my 2nd time at the resort since it opened). World of Color is one of my favorite night time shows of the 8 Disney Parks I've visited. Screamin is a classic and the raft ride is a blast. Guardians of the Galaxy was a genuine surprise at how much we enjoyed it. I've always loved the original tower of terror, but the other iterations left me feeling kind of flat. Honestly, had this ride been built as Guardians, no one would have complained, it is an excellent use of the ride system and a far more enjoyable overall experience than when it was Tower (I still prefer WDW's Tower over Guardians, but this is a great ride). I also found the light comical tone of the ride combined with the industrial atmosphere to be a really fun juxtaposition and it is very fitting with the feel of this park. I hope that the rest of the hollywood section of the park is thematically brought up to snuff somehow and I would certainly like seeing some more marvel attractions. And in spite of my frustration with missing both iterations of the flying tires, we loved the dancing cars that took it's place. Finally, the uncharge for the fastpass system was well worth it to us, we rarely waited in lines and found it easier to use than fastpass+ at WDW. The bad, fastpass return lines are troublesome as people have a difficult time with the scanners and it can be slow getting through that initial return point, but once through that entry point the line moves very quickly. In general, we noticed (at both parks) that the rides frequently stopped because of load/unload backups, but I'm not clear on whether this was a lack of staff, lack of instruction, or a lack of intelligence on the guest's part. We also noticed there were some cleanliness issues. Overall, we had a great time both days we visited and almost had a better time at DCA than at Disneyland, which really surprised me! But we will be back!\",\n",
       " \"Plenty to ride and see. Great entertaining experience. The wait time for rides are not bad especially if you're willing to go on single ride line.\",\n",
       " \"We had a great day out, the park catered for our younger granddaughter as well as the older one. It wasn't our first time here, but it was for the grandchildren.\",\n",
       " \"We loved this place so much. It was incredible. You really can't explain the magic of it until you go yourself. So glad we took the kids (4 & 8) when they were young. It is expensive - but worth every penny!\",\n",
       " 'If you buy the park hopper and use the Disneyland app you can get the both out of both parks. World of Color is wonderful but the standing/seating is a bit complicated and what seems like a good spot can change if you have a tall person move in front of you, the arcade area is something a little different and fun and there are lots of things for you children with shorter lines than fantasy land on the Disney side. We love Disneyland and California adventure just ads to the fun',\n",
       " \"New Soarin' and Guardians of the Galaxy Mission breakout were outstanding. We spent a lot of money, but we also got our money's worth.\",\n",
       " \"Followed the advice online and got a fastpass for Radiator Springs. My whole family loved it - Fastpasses were gone quickly so we didn't get to go a second time. We did get to go on Soarin twice though. My husband and daughter loved the rollercoaster also! We ate at Boudoin Bakery and that was good, too.\",\n",
       " 'So much to do besides the rides. Great for children and adults as well. We always buy the hopper pass so we can go back and forth.',\n",
       " 'Firstly: MaxPass, MaxPass, MaxPass! It was only $10 per day and rushed us through the lines past 30-60 minute wait times. It also allowed us to receive free digital copies of professional photos taken throughout both Disneyland and California Adventure at highlight photo spots. The park itself was a feast for the eyes, boldly colored, and easily laid out. We are two adults (we went for an Anniversary trip) without children, and we had the time of our lives. There were plenty of rides to keep us entertained, even a few that were a little too much for our liking, so if you are a crazy rollercoaster enthusiest or can spin endlessly without getting sick (we can’t) you’ll be in heaven. Our faves were the old Hollywood Tower, now the Galaxy of the Universe ride, which tossed us around like ragdolls. We also loved the water ride. The only downside was that several of the rides seemed to break down throughout the day (maybe due to the extreme heat we were experiencing) including the water ride. Not with us on it, but other poor souls got were trapped mid drop and left in the direct sun for an hour before the ride was working again. Our other favorite was a fast car ride on a large race track, four per car. The track is beautiful! You feel like you’re driving through the desert, and outside of the ride makes for great photo opps as well.The food at the park was decent as well. We rode and ate until we were sick and forced to stop. Would go back again in a heartbeat.',\n",
       " 'Had the chance to go on Gardians of the Galaxy free fall recently and it was fantastic! I always have a great time when I get the opportunity to visit the parks!',\n",
       " 'Took my tow teenage daughters to California Adventure Park and had a great time. While the lines do get annoying long, you can help yourself by getting the FastPass, as a must have. The restaurants are predictably expensive, but I guess knowing this in advance softens the blow. The only suggestion to Disney would be to ensure that the lines of popular rides be fully covered as the heat gets to be a bit much',\n",
       " \"We purposely planned a trip to Disneyland because we wanted to experience things not available at Disney World in Florida. California Adventure Park sure did deliver on that promise! Cars Land was truly amazing with such attention to detail in all of the decor that we easily spent too much time there just staring. We were very disappointed to find out that Fast Pass runs out before noon. We were forced to wait in line for Radiator Springs Racers about 85 minutes and I felt it was probably worth it. The line for the California Screaming roller coaster took up 97 minutes but it was fun.  We waited in line for Soarin for 105 minutes due to technicial difficulties and while it is offered in FL, the scenes are different but not worth that long of a wait. Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission Breakout gave us a 75 minute wait that is debated if it was worth the wait though this ride changes its experience after dark and new Fast Pass becomes available after 4PM. The trolley wasn't running so we were unable to experience that. The Monsters, Inc. show was closed for technical issues. Our feet were calling it a day after waiting in line so much and we chose to skip out on other areas that may have been great if we'd been able to find more comfortable resting places.\",\n",
       " 'Amazing time. Loved the World of Color and Carthay Circle dining package!\\nWe were able to ride all the attractions during this trip. Really fun!',\n",
       " \"We loved California adventure!\\nThe rides are great, cars is awesome! And the waits don't seem as bad as Disneyland.\\nThere's more than enough here that you don't need to spend the extra money to have a hopper pass, you can stay all day.\",\n",
       " 'We enjoyed both parks the rides are great bring water bottle and chips or fruit cuz it can get a little pricey! Deffinetly will return again and again! Make sure everyone has comfortable shoes on!!!! Everything is just so wonderful the parades the characters the rides! It’s such a great family time',\n",
       " \"What a wonderful park to enjoy strolling along different California-themed areas and taking in some thrilling rides. The new Guardians of the Galaxy ride is a definite upgraded Tower of Terror that shouldn't be missed.The World of Color fountain show is awesome and changes each year. During Christmas Season, they have a second Holiday Show starting around mid-November. Be sure to get Fast Passes for these and arrive early to get the best viewing spots. Be sure to arrive as early as the park opens and hit Soaring Over the World, Guardians and the Racers as soon as you can as the wait can be 1-2+ hours.The Aladdin Show was replaced by Frozen...ahhhh.A 3-day park-hopper pass is the best to do both parks but tune up your legs and maybe consider taking a rest day at the beach before doing your third visit....\",\n",

       " \"Arrived at 8:20am on a Wednesday. While the park is not open until 9am to the public, they will let you in past the gates at about 8:30am to see some of the shops near the entrance. We went straight to Cars Land to get Fastpasses for Radiator Springs ride. My 6 year old son liked it so much, we went got Fastpasses to go again. While waiting for entry on the fast pass, we finished all the children's rides in A Bug's Life area and another ride in Cars Land.Got samples of chocolate and bread in the Wharf area.After lunch, went to Paradise Pier and got on several of the small rides, lines were 5-10 minute waits. If it's a hot day, ride the Little Mermaid for A/C.Next, went to the Hyperion Theater for the Frozen show. We chose the Mezzanine level and had a pretty good view.In the evening, went back to Paradise Pier to do Toy Story Mania. This ride was an hour wait without a Fastpass.Finished the day with the World of Color show. Even though we got Fastpasses for the closer viewing area, there were still a lot of people standing that made it hard to see the show. Either sit by the water (they give you a warning that you will get wet) or pay more money for restaurant seating.We had so much to do, that we missed a couple big attractions, Guardians of the Galaxy and Grizzly River Run. Soaring Over the World was closed for refurbishment, the consequence of going in the off-season. I first visited California Adventure when the park originally opened, and we finished it before the end of the day. They have added enough attractions and entertainment that you don't need to park-hop to the Magic Kingdom side enjoy a full day.\",\n",
       " 'My wife and I went here 2 days ago and had a nice time! It is nice to get away from Disneyland for the day and this park is a bit more relaxing. There are many good places to eat and drink and still have a few good rides too! The rollercoaster is really great!',\n",
       " 'Loved this park, great attractions and rides and the world of colour show in the evening was fantastic!We particularly liked the Paradise Pier area and found the whole park to be quieter queue-wise than Disneyland itself. Our favourite rides were California Screamin, Soarin, and Radiator Springs Car ride, which was the only one we needed to fast pass. Some great character photos ops here too, as well as the key characters in different costumes, our favourite was the unique opportunity to meet Oswald. Very friendly and helpful staff to help you make the most of your days.We actually ended up spending more time in this park than in Disneyland and would definitely like to return.',\n",

       " \"I have been to DL many times over the years but never to CALIFORNIA Adventure. We enjoyed a fantastic day riding Cars, Soaring, Ferris Wheel and more. This park is geared for older children and had great access to food, drinks and resting areas throughout the park. The show stopper was the Festival of Lights at night.Can't wait to go back!!\",\n",
       " 'We enjoyed the rides here more than at Disneyland! Guardians is the most amazing ride. The pier is fun. The Little Mermaid and Soarin are here. My 2 year old loved the Frozen show and the Disney Jr show (and meeting Sofia and Doc!). We loved it!!',\n",

Heroes of summer event was excellent and guardian's of the galaxy ride did not disappoint even though tower of terror was my favourite guardians has replaced this. Lots to do even if your little one doesn't like rides. Highly recommend talk with turtle crush and the animation drawing.\",\n",
       " \"Visited the two parks for a total of 5 days. Down during the Halloween celebration which means check the hours the park is open and it closes early (6pm) serval days during the week for Mickeys Halloween Party, which costs another $100 to stay at the park from 6pm-midnight. I can say that getting to the park at 8am when it opens is awesome as there wasn't any wait in the lines when we go here, however by 11am the park started to fill up and by 3pm we had to leave as the park was crazy. A few days we came back in the late evening, the date when the Halloween party wasn't going on to see some of the light shows. Overall, had a fun trip. We made sure to get the Max Pass for an extra $10 per day or $75 with an annual pass to get free photo downloads and fast pass s from your phone. We were able to hit all the major DCA rides in the morning in less than 2 hours. We would use the app to get a fast pass and as soon as we used it were able to reserve another one at another major ride and all of the rides we went on were walk on, with no wait. It was awesome. As the day went on though the fast pass time went from immediate to 30 minutes to several hours later, so going early helped us get everything done, trying to go later meant you had to wait several hours until you could use the fast pass.\",\n",
       " 'We went to adventure land to seek out the fast and exciting rides and wearnt disappointed the screaming California ride was fast and furious with a 5min que and Rocket from guardians of the galaxy was outstanding about 40min to que.

The Grizzley Bear rapid ride - you definately get wet. I wouldn\\'t carry any backpacks or bags on this ride - lockers are provided The Hyperion Theatre is showing Frozen currently - a stage version of the film. Again shops and places to eat. I loved Guardians of the galaxy ride Paradise Pier has the feel of old time ( 1950s) amusement park\\'s with Ferris wheel and roller coaster. Interesting to find a large bakery. Nice bread.

       " \"I don't believe you can say too much about this park. It may have been ho-hum years again, but now it's so fun. The Guardians ride was cool and the additional of the Marvel entertainment. Additionally, it's worth it just for Cars Land. Maybe it's not a two day park, but I'd plan on spending one day for sure.\",\n",
       " 'There were so many things we loved about California Adventure Park. The amusements are very similar to Disney World, but the detail and nostalgia were a real treat for us. We kept on going back to places like Pacific Pier and Car Land to relive some childhood memories. You must get the park hopper day pass so you can explore both sides of the park. We covered almost everything in three days.',\n",

The time posted for the wait times was not even close to the time we spent in lines. We had no luck getting fast passes they were gone very early in the day. The last day we were there we decided to pay for the MaxPass to get a chance at fast passes electronically. It did help but I felt we have already paid enough and then another $10.00 hit for Max Pass per person was not fare. We could only get 2 FP at a time then had to wait for quite a while there were none available but they posted some later in the day. Total of 3 rides from the MaxPass purchase. Rides were always breaking down which is really unpleasant after waiting in long lines. You would think they would be in top condition but it happened to us every day we were there. I really feel Disney Corporation is looking for more and more revenue streams and caring less and less about the guest experience which we have experienced in the past as both Disney California and Walt Disney World. No more \"Have a Magical Day\" or even a smile. Customer service is really terrible. The people operating the rides are bored to death with their jobs and it shows.',\n",
       " \"This park has really evolved for the better since it first opened. You can easily spend the whole day there now that they have added a ton of great rides for all ages as well as must see shows like World of Color. And then there are the drinks and the food. It's the only park that serves alcohol of the two but even the nonalcoholic beverages are so fun! We were here during the Halloween season so this year DCA was decorated to match the season. Once again Disney is stepping up its game. The exclusive food, merchandise, and decor were top notch! If you are visiting the Disneyland Resort you cannot skip this park! It has become an essential part of any Disneyland trip we take!\",\n",

Had a great lunch at Wine Country Trattoria - the California wine flight was delicious and the fettuccine alfredo is excellent.

       " 'The rides and atmosphere here are great - I particularly enjoyed the Cars land and Pacific Pier areas of the park, it was really well done and looked really impressive, especially at night.However, as I found in the Disneyland park the staff seemed uninterested to be there. Nothing like the staff at Disneyworld in Florida who are very much actors in character all day. I tried to buy an alcoholic drink when we returned back to the park in the evening after going across to Disneyland for a few hours, and although all the men in my party were not asked for ID of any kind, I was refused my order. A photocard driving licence was not enough as a passport was what they required (even though both are valid government issued forms of ID). I was not aware this was their policy as this was not mentioned anywhere obviously until I had queued for 15 minutes.One of my party had bought 2 drinks so handed me one, and within 20 seconds I had two security guards asking me for my ID. When I only produced my driving licence they ordered me to get rid of the drink and told us that if I was seen with a drink at any point within the evening I would be escorted out of the park. After I had given my friend the drink back both guards just stood over my mother in law and I (not any males of the party) and kept telling us to have a good night assuming we would walk away. I found their language and demeanour purposefully intimidating, and as I was polite and unaggressive (and 27 so well above drinking age) it seemed completely unnecessary. It was a shame the staff ruined the experience for me, as I really enjoyed the rides and layout of the park.',\n",

Be sure to use FastPass for this ride, Soarin' and Radiator Springs Racers. We loved the food choices and shopping. The character experiences are not abundant here, but we loved seeing Groot! Be sure to download the Disneyland App and you can look to see what characters will be out, including times and locations. Overall we spent about 9 hours here, and were able to do everything we wanted. Definitely not a 2 day park, but a full day is necessary if you want to experience all the attractions. Be sure to make a plan in order to fit everything in. I love this park! I think it's what Hollywood Studios aspires to be!\",\n",

The food was great, but I was a bit disappointed in the character interaction, and didn't like that you had to chase them down to get a picture or signature, and some wouldn't even stop. We didn't think the cast members were not as nice as Disney world, I felt like I missed some of the magic. It was really cool to see walts touch and visit some of his favorite places and try his foods. I'm not sure if we would come back, but it was good for one time! The app is awful, wouldn't work a lot, lost cell phone signal often. The max pass is great though and it was work the extra $10 per ticket per day to not have to walk around to get fast passes, makes your day go by so much better. I also think they should have more photopass in the park, they lacked in that as well.\",\n",
       " 'Lots of fun. One thing that impressed me compared to Disney World is the speed at which the lines move. What would appear to be a 90 minute wait at WDW was less than 20 minutes at Disneyland. The rides were good and an excellent variety in types of rides.',\n",

The Fastpass also gives an added bonus of free digital pics by their photographers and ride pics - bargain!Only downside to the pass is that you are limited to booking (via their app) two rides at a time and there are limited amount of rides that allow you to book via Fastpass meaning you can't avoid the long queue for Mickey's swinging wheel. We visited last Monday, crowds nowhere near as busy as Disneyland and plenty of characters and professional photographers around the park.Fave ride Guardians of the Galaxy and loved the California Screamin' with multiple rides as well as a few others. Plenty of spaces to sit in the shade and eat pre-packed lunch or dine in for purchased meals.Staff were friendly and prices for souvenirs and food were to be expected for a theme park eg $4.75 cotton candy.\",\n",

This park is much smaller than disneyland so can be done much quicker, I would recommend going on the cars ride first thing in the day as it is always such a long wait (80+ mins) in the morning it shouldn't be as long! The world of colour water show in the evening is so beautiful and magical, I've never seen anything like it before and I loved it! Again is $97 for the day.\",\n",

Don't miss world of colour show -it's really cool. Be a single rider for the ride cars to avoid the wait-most your group will go at the same time but in different cars-it's a great way to ride again and again!\",\n",
       " \"This place is very cool. It's in the same location of Disneyland. This is the other park in Disney. This one is all about Lightning McQueen, Bugs, Toy Story, etc. Great for smaller toddlers as the rides are more suitable for them. Big park , you may need a couple of days. Lots of great food, rides, etc. Long lineups... get ready for that. You can take food in the park. All around an amazing theme park.\",\n",
       " \"Myself and my friend travelled to Disney last week. We paid extra for the preferential parking at $35, it got you closer to the escalators & elevators before boarding the Disney tram shuttle, we thought it would be worth it to get to the car sooner after a long day. We waited quite some time to pass through security to board the shuttle, but we managed to get on a shuttle fairly quickly. We got into the park quickly too.We first headed to a store as we both wanted to buy some Disney ears. We found these to be very expensive at around $28 each!Purchasing food & drinks was fairly expensive in the park with not a great deal of choice for allergy sufferers, like myself who needs gluten free foods. I do think you can take in a picnic & cooler boxes though, which would make it a cheaper day. Queues for rides looked enormous. What we did was book fast pass on rides, this gave you a maximum of an hour wait without having to stand in line. We found this really good & spent any time in between going on short queue rides, shopping or grabbing some food. Because of fast pass we managed to go around the park without boredom. We were a little let down that the guardians of the galaxy ride had shut down their fast pass access & the queue was two hours long so we didn't manage to get on this.If you want a decent view of the world of colour night time show, I would suggest getting a spot as soon as you see other people doing the same! We couldn't really find anywhere to go when the show started & just got ushered back and forward by security until we stood behind a group of people. Really amazing show though! Overall we really enjoyed our visit!\",\n",

       " \"Favorite ride was Radiator Springs where we were able to get a FastPass. It was so much fun racing the car next to us! Unfortunately the park was crowded so we were unable to get on all the rides as the lines were long and the Fast Passes went quickly. The only ride we were disappointed in was Mickey's Fun Wheel. You spent most of the time loading/unloading and the wheel barely went around one time. The highlight for us was spending the money for the Dessert Party so that we would have premier seating for the World of Color nighttime show. While everyone else was fighting for an ideal place to stand for viewing, we were seated with no obstruction. We were brought a basket of bread and cheese sticks for sharing and separate plates to include grapes, cheese and sweets to include cheesecakes, shortbread and more. Our server was attentive and the show was great. Highly recommend if you can afford the cost.\",\n",

Tickets are available in plenty of the hotels at the same price as the gate price. Plenty of food and drink available to cater for everyone in the parks. Some of the popular rides can have long queues so use your fast passes sensibly. The more days you book the better the value so work out how many visits you need. You do NOT have to use your ticket on consecutive days, a 3 day pass lasts 13 days from the first use. Great place.',\n",
       " \"Had a great time with my young adult kids (1 just finished University and the other almost done - no category for 'Family with college kids'!). They updated California Soarin' to Soarin' Around The World which is a nice change. Also no longer Aladdin but had been replaced with Frozen which was just as good! Biggest change was 'Tower of Terror' to 'Guardians of the Galaxy - Breakout' which we found better than the original! Thanks Disney for always striving to update for your guests.\",\n",
       " \"Although small for the price, We actually enjoyed Disney California Adventure more than Disneyland. Each area was clean and well designed, with a decent amount of food choices. I'd have to say that the Cars land was the best part - felt like you were walking the actual set for the cars movie. Nice job with all the buildings and landscapes. If you choose just one ride to experience - you have to do Radiator Springs Racers in Car Land... more than once if you have time!\",\n",

The Newsies music and the whole 20's type feel is so much fun! The color show at the end of the night is beautiful- get a fast pass as soon as you come in the park so you can stand near the pier. Radiator Springs is right out of the Cars movie!!\",\n",

Oh my gosh, this show is incredible! It is well worth visiting, and sooo nice as a place to go right at 12pm, when the sun is getting hot. The performers are incredible and it's a lovely theatre. The other attraction that was noticeably different was the previous Tower of Terror, which is now a Guardians of the Galaxy attraction. Other than these, the park is familiar and a great place to hang out. I love the Little Mermaid ride. Turtle Talk with Crush was really incredible and the kids down the front seemed to absolutely love it. I would recommend this as a great way to engage kids, especially mid-afternoon when it's getting a bit hot outside. This is a fun park to visit. It's not as 'Disney' as Disneyland, but there are loads of good rides and it really caters for the little ones as well.\",\n",
       " \"One day was plenty. We got there early and rode a bunch of rides without waiting (and without the fast pass) before it got really busy. Utilise the fast pass system when it is busy, saves so much time per ride if you use it right. Some really good rides; rollercoaster, arial's undersea adventure, cars, water rapids (you get soaked, but it's great fun), and more. A couple more thrilling ones than Disneyland. The World of Colour show was amaaaazing, make sure you go. We got a fast pass for it in the morning (you can get other fast passes during the day in addition to having this one), and got a great viewing spot right on the edge of the water. The food we had was average. Best to go out of the park to eat. Fountains everywhere, bring a bottle to refill it.\",\n",
       " \"Disney California Adventure suffers by the mere fact that it is located adjacent to the most well-known amusement park in the world. If this park were located anywhere else it would be a hit and be a popular destination. But since it is next too to the Magic Kingdom, it is unfairly compared and judged as the lesser sibling to the park that started it all. The upside is that California Adventure is more adult oriented meaning there are more things and places for adults to go to and experience. The rides are faster and more intense that many at the Magic Kingdom. As well, there are restaurants and bars that offer full bars and upscale dining alternatives that are simply not available at the other park! The fact you can drop in to a bar and get a Manhattan or a properly served and presented Martini in the middle of an amusement park, that goes a LONG way at making this adult park goer a very happy park attendee. From the rides to the dining options and the overall layout, this park is not to be missed or overlooked. Do your self a favor and START your adventures at California Adventure and then head to the Magic Kingdom. You'll be glad you did. And Stop in to Carthay Circle for a cocktail. You'll love it!\",\n",
       " 'What a great place. We bought a hopper park ticket and only spent a few hours here in the late afternoon and evening.

Very cool experience!\",\n",

As sad as I was to see Tower of Terror go, I absolutely love the new Guardians ride.

Make sure you get your fast pass for World of Color! Also get your fast pass for Radiator Springs as the stop giving those out. We had the Maxpass plus and it was amazing.

It's more modern, well laid out, spacious and has a flow to it. The separate areas are so thematic it's like being in different parks as you move around. We were disappointed that 3 of the main attractions were closed for refurb during our visit and queue wait times were generally longer in this park but I can only say that I think it's because the rides are better in this park. Would 100% recommend going back in the evening to watch the World of Colour fountain show. It's truly spectacular.\",\n",

My only complaint is that by the time we made it to the roller coaster, \"California Screamin\" (I think that\\'s what it was called) we had an hour and half before the parks closed but they said it was too close to let more people in line.

While my older son LOVED the \"California Screamin\\' rollercoaster and the Grizzly River Run. Both kids thought the Cars ride was the best one in the park and made us do that one 3 times, thank goodness there was a fast pass option. For lunch we went to Flo\\'s V-8 diner and had a good lunch mostly it was great to be in AC -it was so hot the day we visited this park.

Everyone loved the little mermaid ride and toy story midway. The talking Mr potato head was cute and funny. Over all except from getting sick on something i ate in the cozy cone area of cars land it was a hit. World of color was pretty cool although avoid the reserved seating tho. You can see more of the show without it.',\n",

Unfortunately it just doesn't get close to the parks in Florida. I would say there are fewer big rides but the major thing is the lack of shows, street entertainers or visual spectacles as not everybody likes thrill rides. It's quite a small park really.\",\n",

Space mountain game In Paris is amazing while in California I didn't like it while Indiana jones California is way nicer than the one in Paris .

So for us it was a nice break from all the crazy crowds and really long lines. I highly recommend getting the hopper pass can you go see can go to both California adventure and Disneyland.They also do serve alcohol in this park at certain restaurants.

The park was still busy but we only had to wait a maximum of 30 minutes for any ride which was great. The food was good and actually pretty reasonably priced. There was a mix up with our lunch order and so we had an unacceptably long wait but we wererefunded our bill. We wore our 'first time visitor' badges but only one cast member acknowledged them! So glad we didn't queue at City Hall for ours (the man at the front of the queue advised us to get ours from any of the stores) ... bit of a waste of time!!! However .... a great day out! Glad to have visited the original Disney Park.\",\n",
       " 'The park was awesome, great attractions for all ages. Cars, California screaming, grizzly peak rapids and guardians of the galaxy are a must, you will get wet on the rapids! If you like good food get down to the Pacific wharf and the garden grill, they do much better food than standard theme park food.',\n",
       " \"My wife and I visited Disney California Adventure for the first time on a Friday in early September, and we had a fantastic day! Because school was back in session and there was unusually hot and humid weather, crowds were fairly light. We enjoyed the tour of our amazing state, with stops in Grizzly Peak and Hollywood Land, among others.Our favorite adventures were Soarin' Around the World and the Radiator Springs Racers. Due to sparse crowds, we were able to ride each three times with minimal wait.After a full day at the park, we went back to our hotel to clean up before returning to the park for the spectacular World of Color show. We highly recommend that as a great end to the day!\",\n",
       " 'Rides close much earlier than park due to water show, was told rudely by ride operator it is only the waterfront rides that close, even the ice cream place on the Pier shuts, as we saw people turned away, the rude operator said other rides remain open, untrue we went to junkyard jamboree it was also closed everything shuts down early for a water show absolutely ridiculous when the park is open until 9, go early & definitely get a queue jumper pass as there will be a load of people walk past while you wait up too 2 hrs, but it comes at a cost of course as that is exactly what Disneyland is designed to do extract as much cash as possible, they don\\'t care there \"GUESTS\" queue for hrs & the operators leave seats & cars empty! Better value at other parks for sure. Especially when I paid $1300 Aus for a 2 day pass & a Canadian family for a 5 day pass for $1k',\n",
       " 'Don\\'t miss DCA if you have teenagers. They would love the atmosphere and the rides. It is a real Disney experience for older kids and adults too. Read up the fastpass uses and make full use of it especially if you go during American school holidays. I am over 50 with a teenager and I had a great time! First thing when you get in whilst taking photos, head to Little Mermaid ride and as you approach the building there is a right side lane where you will find Passes for the World of Colour. Collect them as the show is at 9pm at Paradise Pier. When I was young, I loved all the Disney TV series and movies of Mickey and his friends, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White, etc ... never would I have believed it if someone had told me \"you will be in Disneyland one day\". It was too unreal to go to that magic world far away. I went to France and Japan but refused to visit Disneyland there because I considered them replicas of Walt\\'s dream world. And last month, unbelievably, because of my son who plays Pokémon card game, he was awarded paid trip to Anaheim and I had the opportunity to finally see Disneyland! I had the best time of my life and cried unashamedly when watching the World of Colours which is a magical night time experience for all families, NOT To BE MISSED! How amazingly music, video and water could be interplayed at the Paradise Pier, too brilliant! Unbelievable that they recreated all the magic of Disney in this 20 minute visual-water-audio performance making everything appear 3D within the water sprays. Nostalgia coursed through me with excerpts from well known movies such as Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, Little Mermaid, etc interwoven at special moments in each film. I am over 50 but felt like a young teenager - loved every moment of the show. Now, not forgetting the incredible rides such as Grizzly Peak, Guardians of the Galaxy (we were lucky as we saw adult Groot outside posing for photos), the California Screaming (I screamed all right), Goofy\\'s Sky school (scarier, for me, than California screamin), the Zephyr, Mickey\\'s Ferris Wheel (went in the non swinging gondola), even the Little Mermaid, to just have a quiet non scary ride. I felt the DCAP was better for families with older kids and Disneyland for the younger kids, though there are some plucky youngsters who kept returning for the scarier rides. And you must not miss Soaring through the World. Absolutely mind blowing ride - amkes you feel as if yiu were an eagle flying through the many worlds they take us through. Read up on Fastpasses as they really help with going through long lines but remember that fastpasses provide for specific time of day and you have to plan your rides and movement around the park accordingly. Also, once you get one fastpass for a specific ride, it doesn\\'t allow you to get another fastpass for another ride until after some time has passed. So, take all that into account. My friend purchased the Maxpass for additional US$10 and she said she felt it worth it because she was able to get photos as well easily from the rides that take photos of you as you ride past specific points. I found it all too complicated and just queued as the wait was within an hour for most rides. Note that all restaurants are expensive inside the park as well as in Downtown Disney, btu the service is great. For those who like a touch of old world classy restaurant ambience and food, please go to the Carthay circle restaurant. It was wonderful to see age old photos of Walt with all the young actors like Shirley Temple, Julie Andrews, musicians, comedians, and voices of Walt\\'s characters. The service staff are friendly, very open to us wanting to share our dishes instead of eating our own, and totally attentive. Don\\'t forget to tip! As mentioned earlier in my review for Disneyland, do not go during American school holidays or you will curse the queues for every part of the two parks starting with the Security queues outside. One last thing, if you lose any item, go to the Lost and Found, report and describe what you lost, and if they dont find it before you leave, they will mail it to your home wherever you are in the world, free of charge! This is their promise!',\n",
       " \"California Adventure is directly across from Disneyland. It includes bigger and newer rides than Disneyland. I loved the new Cars land, and the Radiator Springs Racers ride was really fun. California Screamin' is one of Disney's best roller coasters, either in California or Florida. I was skeptical about the rework of Tower of Terror (I loved the old Tower of Terror), but Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout was a really fun new take on that ride. And I also loved the Animation Academy, where a Disney artist teaches you how to draw a character.\",\n",

       " 'In February I took my 23 year old and 16 year old on vacation to Southern California. We had a blast at California Adventure. I feel this park is more geared to older kids/adults. We love all the rides. Cars and Soaring being my personal favorites. There is a huge selection of food. We ate at The Cove Bar for the first time. (We have been to the park many times) It was wonderful. Plan a full day for this park.',\n",
       " 'We figured we would like this park but wow it was spectacular! As my kids are now teens, this really is a better way to spend a day than Disneyland park. The cars ride is a must see, as is Guardians of the Galaxy, Soarin, and the California coaster. A ton of other fun stuff is available, and the atmosphere is fabulous!',\n",

       " \"Loved Disneyland it's a little pricey for food inside the park, however, you will not find nicer staff!! This was my first trip at 35 years old with my 2 year old daughter and I can honestly say I understand what all the hype is about!! I do like Disneyland Park better than California Adventure if you have small children. I feel like there is more shade and better rides for them!\",\n",
       " \"You can't go wrong with a trip to Disneyland. Even though the lines can be long and there's always a ton of people, Disneyland can be different with each visit there. I recommend that if you have passes, go as much as you can and enjoy one part of the park each visit. That way, you can find the rides you and your family enjoy the most and then go straight to those ones when you go the next time. Mickey rocks!\",\n",
       " 'Second time to Anaheim and we love this park, World of Color is absolutely amazing. Car land is brilliant, the theming is as good as anything in any Park. My only advice is \"don\\'t go in August\", my own fault. But very very busy.',\n",
       " 'There are some great, fun rides but there are also some that felt like they belonged in a carnival, not Disneyland. Neither of the parks are Senior Citizen friendly. Just be aware!',\n",
       " \"Fantastic place for the whole family. Rides are awesome - Soaring around the World is brilliant, Radiator Springs Racers is even better. Use fast passes, they will save your sanity, patience and probably your marriage. Absolutely loved our time at California Adventure, we had 4 day park hopper tickets and spent at least half our time on the California Adventure side. Don't miss it.\",\n",
       " \"We visited in August during a heatwave but this didn't stop us from loving this park. The cars land was our favorite but all the themed areas were great. Fast pass worked well for us and would love to visit again.\",\n",
       " \"Liked this one, but not as much as Disneyland. Our kids were too young and didn't have a lot of rides to go on. Only spent half the day there, and regretted using our 1 park per day pass, when we should of used it on Disneyland which was made for families and young children! Will go again, when kids are older! But still a good park.\",\n",
       " \"My son was super excited to visit McQueen and Mater - and the park delivered! There were some lines but with a few Fast Passes and a little bit of waiting here or there, it was all good. The restaurants have reasonably priced kids' options and the staff is all around great!\",\n",
       " \"Very disappointed how Disney's customer service seems to be going down every time I visit. Witnessed employees argue with another employee in front of children.\",\n",
       " \"It's a wonderful place to visit but if you wish to ride all the major attractions you must get there when it opens !!\",\n",
       " \"The park speaks for itself and does not need reviews to describe how great it is. Rather, here are some tips that will help you:-park hopper option is great so that you can go between parks midday-pack snacks for kids and yourselves to tie you over until dinner-bring water bottles. They have tons of water fountains so bring a bottle rather than spending on water. We used collapsible ones to save space. -comfy shoes or sandals are a must. Walking all day so wear something comfy. Sandals are fine for all rides!-if you get at least the 3 day hopper pass, you will receive an early entry admission where you can go 1 hour before the park actually opens to take pictures. This was the best time for us to take photos as it was much less crowded and lines with the Disney characters were short. -bring cooling towels. These saved us when it was +40 outside. Simply wet them and they keep you cooler all day-the busiest rides at Disneyland when we went was Soarin and Radiator springs. Best to pull a fast pass for these once the park opens and then enjoy other rides while you wait. -lobster nachos at the cove restaurant are well priced and can easily feed 2 people. Highly recommended. Located California adventure side. -dole whip is another must try outside the tiki room. Located Disneyland side. There's alot to do at both parks. Not just rides but getting autographs from characters or pictures with them. Everything takes time so 3 days for both parks is reasonable. Take your time and enjoy being a kid again. -\",\n",
       " \"This is my first visit in a number of years and they have really made the park special. Carsland is great and if you want to ride the racers just go in as a single rider and you go right to the front of the line. The New Guardians tower ride is better and more exciting. Another tip is that all the quick service Restauant's will serve you free water in a cup upon request.\",\n",
       " 'Great addition to Disneyland, excellent rides and atmosphere, great to go here if Disney is busy with a parade or event.',\n",
       " \"Had a blast at California Adventure. Crowds were moderate so we waited in a few long lines but overall not too bad. The most frustrating part was Soarin Around the World and the cars ride both broke down on us. I ended up sitting in a car with my seat belt on for 30 min. I wasn't too thrilled about that.\",\n",
       " \"Wonderful place completely different from other Disney theme parks (been to 3 more). Indeed the main ride is Cars and all around Radiator Springs. Suggestion: go midweek out of school holiday and you won't need fastpass. Guardian of the Galaxy and Toy Story are also pretty good. The panoramic wheel offers great views and stay for the fireworks at 9pm: amazing !\",\n",
       " 'Had a 3 day pass to Disney and we decided to opt for the Adventure Land first. A great time was had by all but if only we had invested in fast or max passes!! We live and learn and surely did when visiting the Disney Park later on in the week. Cars Land was great fun on all the rides, the Ferris Wheel was a hit and the Pool Spectacular in the evening after the parade was fantastic. A fabulous setting, great staff but not quite there compared to its neighbour!!',\n",
       " 'We spend 3 days in Disneyland and California Adventure Park, although most of the time we were at the disneyland side. California Adventure Park has less disney flavor but some great rides like the Guardians of the Galaxy, Cars, California Screaming, and the Grizzley River Run. We enjoyed lunch at the Radiators Springs area.',\n",

       " \"Arrived early as recommended (8.30am). Went on a non early bird day. Line up at Cal Adv Pk a lot shorter than DPk. Gates opened at 9.30. Went straight to area as close to Radiator Springs ride (area roped off til 10am, official opening time). Found out when in line here that RSprings ride temporarily closed so best to get FastPass. Did this (highly recommend downloading app prior to check wait times as well as pre look at map to know your bearings). Went to Guardians of the galaxy new ride. Had to wait in line as already used FPass for RSprings (can only FPass 1 ride at a time except World of Colour show). Line up wasn't that long for Guardians of the galaxy. Kept checking app to see if RSprings open while we checked out other sections of the park. Recommend getting FPass for World of colour early. This guarantees you a spot close to the action. (FPass near Aerial under the Sea ride). RSprings ride finally opened. By the time we got over there it had shut down again. Decided to hang around RSprings area & then noticed people on the ride. Used our FPass. Waited about 20mins though as ride hadn't been operational for a few hours so lots of people using FPasses from earlier time slots. Worth the wait. Awesome ride. Kids wanted to go again. Lined up in general wait line as FPass timeslot not free til 3-4hrs time. Had to wait approx 40mins to get back on ride. Spent whole day at park. Left around 5 to go back to hotel (stayed at Park Vue Inn which was literally across the road). Chilled for a bit before we headed back around 7.30 for World of Colour. FastPass said no early entry available & entry from 7.45pm onwards. Arrived just before this & people everywhere so ignore what FPass says. Managed to get a good spot (basically standing only in all areas) in an area at the front (prepared to get a bit wet). Was a warm night so didn't bother us. World of Colour is 20mins of light & water spectacular. Fantastic. Had a great time.\",\n",

There are literally books and books and unlimited sites on the topic, so I won't leave a crazy long review... just go.Don't just go... PLAN! The one thing (besides sickness or something like that) that can prevent a wonderful Disney trip is the lack of planning... This is a popular place, so you should look into the right times to go and what to do when so you're full prepared.\",\n",
       " 'My wife and I were on the scream roller coaster ride and when we took off on the ride someone threw a whole cup of hard alcohol at the ride and drilled my wife in the elbow and covered her in jack in coke. Her elbow now has a huge golf ball size knot on it the guys working on the ride were not very helpful on finding them but did offer the people in front of us and my wife free shirts and shorts at any store',\n",
       " \"I was in DCA twice before but this was my first trip since the changes and addition of Carsland. I enjoyed the laid back feel of DCA and Carsland is great! The Racers ride is excellent and much better than Test Track in Disneyworld. The themed food is cool too - mac and cheese in a bread cone! My family loved Guardians of the Galaxy and California Screaming (I'm a chicken and skipped them). There are plenty of rides for really small kids too. I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed World of Color! It is the night time water show. It is just amazing. I should have skipped Fantasmic (which I've seen in DW) and watched WOC a second time. There is something for everyone here - my daughter enjoyed a drawing lesson from a Disney animator at the Animation Academy. Oh and you can order alcohol here too if that's something you're looking for. Its a great park and you really should take time to see it if you're at Disneyland. I'd recommend 1/3 of your time here and 2/3 at Disneyland.\",\n",
       " 'I went to Disney California Adventure in March 2017 for the first time. I enjoyed the time. The park is beautiful, and there are lots of things to do. The food needs to improve, and they need more organization for the light show. Overall it was a great experience.',\n",
       " 'We enjoyed our first trip to Disney California. Not as much attractions at Disneyland but we love the more laid-back Vibe of Disney California. Guardians of the Galaxy ride is a must-do at this place it was exhilarating.',\n",
       " \"We did this and Disneyland on a three day park hopper pass with our 2.5 yr old (free til 3 yrs old). Her favourites were the bug world area and cars rides. Obviously she couldn't go on everything but there's still so much to keep a little one very busy. The surprise for us was the live frozen show. What an amazing show! It's something we'd pay to see as a touring stage show like Disney on ice when it came to NZ. We didn't know what we were going to see but it was amazing. Loved the Disney Junior dance party - so great to have such a great interactive show for the littlest visitors. Food and facilities great, made it easy to cater to our toddler, although we took some snacks with us also.Photopass is brilliant! For both parks, if you haven't found out about it make sure you do. Disney photographers are around to take photos of you on their cameras and will use yours too if you ask. Collect a card and get them to scan it each time you have photos taken. Then at the end of each day, go into the Disneyland app and link them to your login. For $10 each day you can pay for digital downloads of all your days photos, or you can go into the stores in the park and pay for prints of your photos. It meant we got family pictures that we just never get otherwise.\",\n",
       " \"We bought the Southern California City Pass and with that got 3 days at Disneyland and Disney's California adventure. We loved this park. The Cars land is amazing and looks just like the movie and even more amazing at night. I suggest getting to the park when it opens and doing the Cars ride first the line does get long quick. The new Guardians ride is so much fun we road several times thanks to the Disney app to fastpass. We also enjoyed the Toy story ride, soaring, the parade at 6:15 was so much fun and the World of Color at night was just amazing. We had a great time at this park.\",\n",
       " \"Anything Disney is great. I like the other side of the park better personally. And I'm not a huge marvel fan and right now California adventure is all superheroes!!!? But it's still Disney.\",\n",
       " \"We loved our visit even more this time due to the MaxPass system! It made our lives super convenient, getting passes for any rides we wanted without running all over the parks! We go several times a year and have annual passes, and can't wait to be able to add the MaxPass to it for much less than a daily charge (It's $10 per person per day). And of course, the park was clean and beautiful and fun every day! Definitely check out World of Color and get the fastpass for best seating.\",\n",
       " 'We had a great time at this park with our kids, ages 4 and 8. Line wait times were minimal as we arrived before the park opened and took advantage of FastPasses when we could. The World of Color night show was beautiful and worth viewing, but it would be nice to have a seating area. Even with a Fast Pass to reserve a spot, you stand for the entire show.',\n",
       " 'Spent two days here and that was enough to see and do everything at this park. Of corse this means 14 hour days so be prepared to walk and stand a lot. Use Fast Pass whenever possible to ride the most popular rides. Use the singles line for most unless you just have to sit next to or behind friends or family. You will save many hours of line wait if you do this. The California Screamin roller coaster is the best ride at this park. Cars Land is very fun.',\n",

Maybe this park is more for teenagers and adults, while the other one is better for toddler.Anyway, as boths parks are one in front of another in a short walking distance (not in Orlando, where distances are huge), it's recommended to purchase the park hopper in order to jump from one park to the other on the same day.If you buy SoCal Pass, hopper is included.Restaurants, attractions, souvenir shops... everything can be found once you cross this magic door.\",\n",
       " 'Had a cool time at Disneyland with our 7 year old son and could access all the rides. To be fair we found California Adventure Land to be superior by far as did our little boy. Possibly Mickey and Goofy etc ate losing their shine a bit? It has been a while now.....',\n",
       " 'This is a great park for the really young kids and also the kids around 8-12. We actually preferred this park to Disneyland but this was largely due to us having an 8 year old son with us who found the rides here more interesting to him so if he was happy we were happy. The lines are just as long as they are in Disneyland but we stayed at Disneyland Resort so we got access to the park an hour earlier than everyone else one day which is definitely worth the effort of getting up early.',\n",
       " \"Lines weren't too long if you used fast pass but one day we were there, numerous rides were down so we had to keep going back and forth between Disneyland and Cali Adventure as our timing wasn't working out as planned. Clean, polite staff. Fun rides and great shows.\",\n",

We waited max 40 minutes for a ride, but everyone was getting on that ferris wheel so we decided to skip it, the wait was just astronomical. Go to California Adventure during their summertime wine event! I tasted wines and tried delicious beers while riding The Little Mermaid, haha. Definitely a lot of fun for the older kids.',\n",

It's a jumble of attractions found in various other Disney parks (Little Mermaid ride, Turtle Talk, what was Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, Soarin', Toy Story Midway Mania, It's tough to be a bug). So you've got content from all 4 WDW parks in that list. Then the rest seems to be one-trick 1-minute rides. The list of these is endless. Jumpin Jellyfish, Golden Zephyr, Silly Symphony Swings, all of A Bug's Land, both rides in Carsland not named Radiator Springs Racers. All of these rides could be at any amusement park in the country. CA has no Pirates or Haunted Mansion type rides that aren't thrill rides but are spectacular and repeatable.

I walked away so impressed with the attention to details for rides and characters. Unfortunately, for my wife and I, we have visited Disney World in Orlando. The California parks do not compare, in our opinion. The Radiator Springs ride was tops for my family of two boys. We truly wanted to experience since it's arrival to the park. Photographers made our day at the park by being so willing to take photos using their creativity. My wife was extremely grateful. We felt the rides were not the best, but truly appreciated the experience. California Screamin' rocked and hands down was our favorite. All in all, we had a good experience, but probably will not be flying from Texas again if giving the option of World vs. Land.\",\n",

My dad and I went to the Disney parks and can say that both parks provided a fun family environment.Therewas many things to do like the cars attraction, the California screamin',the guardians of the galaxy mission breakout etc. The service was great every employee gave us a fine service.The California Adventure park is a fun park for kids, teens, adults and even elders. We also dined at the Carthay restaurant and it was fabulous.The whole day me and my dad had something to do wether we went to the wildest or we sat down and enjoyed the view of the pier.Overall I think it was a really amazing experience\",\n",

World of Color was also on par with other Disney nighttime shows. That said, the entire Paradise Pier area feels more like a Six Flags or carnival than a Disney theme park. While California screaming and a toy story mania are outstanding, the rest of the area needs a significant upgrade. All in all, this is strictly a one day park, while Disneyland, with its classic Disney feel and attractions requires two days. Still, for the aforementioned attractions, I wouldn't skip it altogether it skip it altogether.\",\n",

Wish we could have more photos taken with our package. It was hard to find a photographer. Our son lost his hat on one of the rides and one of the crew members was amazing to us. She was able to get a replacement hat within 10mins and our son was so happy he was able to get another hat. The crew members go above and beyond. We made sure we went into guest relations to give them a happy-gram. These cast members work hard and have a high standard to keep. I know they helped us many times with finding a quiet area. I really enjoyed this park a lot more and wish we had some more time to spend at both.A couple of things I would do better next time. Type of footwear and spare. spare clothing if you can and the warm jacket was needed. The kids and the big kids (adults/parents) had a great time.',\n",
       " 'California Adventure is a fun park. There are plenty of rides for everyone. Loved the river rapids. Was bummed that we were unable to get in to Soarin. The lines are incredible most of the day. Plenty of shopping and eating stops.',\n",
       " 'I first visited California Adventure the year it opened, then a couple times since but the last time was a decade ago. Back then it never felt like a full park — it felt like an extra land at Disney but with a jumbled theme and spread out over a wide area. Some of the attractions were fine but there wasn’t enough… Not it is. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still best experienced by parking hopping with Disneyland and it still can’t compare to the range and breadth of attractions at Disneyland. But having been to Disneyworld many times I would easily rank California Adventure on its own up there with most of those stand alone parks other than the Magic Kingdom.DCA now has quite a few first-rate rides. There’s a great roller coaster, Toy Story Mania (a family favorite), Cars Radiator Springs, Soarin’ (a great one for the full family), and the new Guardian’s ride. My family went in to that ride wanting to hate it. We are loyal fans of the original Twilight Zone Tower of Terror which is what was refurbished to make the Guardians attraction. I hated the idea of gutting a truly original ride that was obviously tailor built for the original theme. And we hate the idea of converting everything to service the Disney franchises. Sadly, we couldn’t hate it. We loved it. More than we had liked Tower of Terror. Blasphemous I know. It’s just more fun, which fits the spirit of the actual thrill part of the ride. Instead of just a dark room where you randomly drop a few times, the dropping is interspersed with videos from the Guardians cast and the whole thing was set to great music, any of six songs. The interior is supported to be the lair of The Collector and there are tons of Marvel artifacts and Easter Eggs. The pre-show is now a fun experience with an animatronic Rocket. The only part that still feels like the old Tower of Terror is the last queue room before the ride which still feels like the boiler room of the old Hotel with some stuff placed there to make it look more high tech and spacey.Overall we were all very pleased with the park.',\n",
       " \"Having a late start the park opens at 9:00 and not arriving until 10:30 thinking the rides would have taken the brunt of the early riders our mistake the majority of the major rides were closed or broken down. We queued for 45 minutes and still 15 minutes to go and ride breakers down. The rollercoaster California screamer was still being tested at 12:40 and still took ages to finally open. The queues on average because the majority of the best rides were closed or broken down was 80 minutes. Because of this most of the restaurants were full. It cost $110 + $20 parking to get In but it's just not good value for money.\",\n",
       " 'We came for the day with our toddler who loves all things Disney. The place was clean and everything was well maintained. The staff were very friendly and courteous. Our daughter loved the characters and they interact well with the children. We were there on a Thursday so the crowds were not too big and the lines were fairly short. The snacking and dining option are very good but prices can be moderate to high. This is a great place to go for all ages and you could spend at least a day or two in this park and still not have done and seen it all. We will definitely go back.',\n",

We had no idea that it'd take us up & down the elevator extremely fast. The most scariest ride ever for this family, and the last one of those to ride. We still have a good laugh about it, though. The river ride was fun. Our kid enjoyed the games that were by the pier/ferris wheel area. He scored lots of stuffed animals. In the evening the World of Colors was amazing, and I highly recommend watching. Getting fastpass for that would be worth it as we were in the back, and it was a bit difficult to see the whole water show. All in all, an experience worth with your family.\",\n",

       " 'Similar to Disneyland, except I would suggest this park is for more older children, not toddlers. There is so much to see, hear, ride and do that your days (and nights) will be packed.Some things I can think of that might not have been said yet:- Besides money, sunscreen and water…bring your patience. There is a lineup for everything you do there, so expect it and accept it. Disney is great at tricking you with the lines. It might not look long but when you get in and realizes it loops multiple times, then goes in a building and out again, it is likely longer than you expected. They are good at offering shade while in line for the most part, which is nice.- Don’t trust the times on the line signs…they never seemed to be accurate for any of the rides and in fact it was always a longer wait than the sign said.- Obviously use the fastpass system when you can…it will save you lots of time.- If you are from Canada (like us), note that they do not accept a Canadian Driver’s License for alcoholic drinks. Even though I am mid 40 years old, they refused to serve me a drink with my government issued drivers license.- You can bring snacks in – so bring some. It will save you time and money. Also…bring a refillable water bottle as there are stations to fill up yourself.- Last…relax, be patient and have fun…remember…you are on vacation!!Thanks for reading…happy travels!!',\n",

I will be back in the future and bring my mom with us.\",\n",

       " \"Radiator Springs, that is why we came to DCA. We stayed on property so we were able to take advantage of the extra morning hour and really, that is the way to go. Everyone heads to the car ride in Radiator Springs first - it was a mob of people. But we got on right away and then got a fastpass for a 2nd ride later. If you are staying close by, go right when they are open, get the big rides done/get your must have fastpasses before the park opens to the rest of the world and then enjoy your day. The lines in both parks got long around mid-day and stayed that way until later in the day. Soarin' also gets a really long line that lasts so I recommend going there with a fastpass. They will run out of fastpasses for both that and the Radiator Springs car ride and the lines are impossibly long without them. We only had one day to do DCA and it was very doable. We rode everything we wanted to ride and took a break during the hottest part of the day and went back to our hotel for a swim (Grand Californian). They have just come out with MaxPass and I was looking forward to using it (was going to cost us $10/per person) but it wouldn't take my credit card. Lucky for me because we didn't need it at all. We only do one park a day and were able to get along just fine with one person (me) running to get the FP that we wanted. I could see if you had Park Hopper tickets where it would be good to have. You can get a FP in one park if you are in the other and not have to leave the park you are in. Otherwise, save your money. I don't see an advantage. We got the fastpasses we wanted and even some we weren't planning on.\",\n",

The new Marvel area is a nice addition but we'll miss our favorite Tower of Terror ride which has now become the Guardians of the Galaxy experience. Ariel's Grotto never fails to impress young princesses at heart, and California Screamin' remains one of the best roller coasters we've ever ridden. The new Max Pass system is well worth the money and highly recommended (though beware that the app will drain your battery). If you've never been to a Disney resort, definitely start with Disneyland but if you're looking for something new and different, California Adventure is great fun for the whole family.\",\n",
       " \"Okay, it's not the main Disney park but there's some great rides in this park too - Ariel's ride is lovely and the Marvel district is great. There are less rides than the main park but a lovely pier area with shops and the big wheel. Can't give this park 5 stars due to grumpy staff on the hot dog stand and an obnoxious staff member in the shop behind the big wheel that tarnished the visit and the awful Ariel's grotto restaurant but the park itself is well worth a trip.\",\n",

We kept trying, but they were never where the app we were using said thy were. 2nd day we looked for 3 hours. Finally found her favorite. Alaina! She was very kind. Then found the princesses from frozen. In the \"off the page\" exhibit. After looking for 4 hours we were ushered into a quiet private room with the two caste members. The experience was so intimate it made all the adults cry! The caste members and photographers were amazing! We walked away in tears saying to each other, \"I can\\'t believe they just did that! It was like it was just for us! My daughter is the only girl in a house full of boys. This made our trip!',\n",

Paradise Pier was amazing and probably my favorite part of the park. We rode everything and even played the boardwalk games. Spent a lot of time in that part of the park. Loved the attention to detail in Cars Land, too. Pacific Wharf had good food, Ghirardelli, and a tour of a bread bakery. I was not sure if we would enjoy the Guardians ride since it replaced a favorite, the Tower of Terror, but we really enjoyed it. Highly recommend Carthay Circle Restaurant for lunch or dinner if you want a table service meal!',\n",

       " 'What can you say about California Adventure that hasn\\'t been said already?Here\\'s why we loved it in particular:- It feels less \"frantic\" than Disneyland. At no point did we feel rushed (although it still took us a couple of days to see it all properly)- There is truly something for everyone, from ages 0 to 100+. My baby boy LOVED the Bugs Land, whereas my elderly parents LOVED Soaring Over The World- The live performances (we saw Frozen) are AMAZING- The World Of Colour is BREATHTAKING. Our entire family, from my 1 year old son, my two teenagers, and my 70+ father were spellbound for the entire show.- The parade is thoroughly enjoyable, and not so long that my toddler had a meltdown- There are shops a-plenty, but it doesn\\'t feel like you are are funnelled through a shop after every ride- The pier (where the giant ferris wheel is located) is beautiful. We were happy just to sit here and soak in the atmosphere, and general happiness.- I have a soft-spot for the Little-Mermaid ride, because my baby-boy wanted to go on it several times, and there was practically no wait in the queue.',\n",
       " \"A fun park. The boardwalk area has a lot to offer for kids and teens. Don't eat at Flo's V8 Diner. The food was the worst I've eaten in any park. Soaring is the same as in Epcot. Cars Land was fun - a remake of TestTrack from Epcot with some extra stuff thrown in. The World of Color is worth going to as well - a water show with lights, similar in some ways to Fantasmic. Gardians of the Galaxy is the old Tower of Terror with new twist. Was not crazy about the New Cathay eatery. Expensive and food was not that great. You have to go and see this place if you are there to see Disneyland, but its not a destination on its own in my opinion.\",\n",
       " \"What's not to love? The happiest place on earth for my kids. I loved that it was not too big of a park. We were able to do the entire park in one day. Leaving to go to downtown Disney for lunch and dinner. Wait time for us on the rides was 15 minutes at the most. The only ride I found to be a ridiculous amount of time was Radiator Springs Cars ride. Totally not worth the wait even with the fast pass.\",\n",
       " 'This park was so much better than Disneyland. Cars land is amazing. The park is not as busy, and seems to flow better. Use the fast passes on the big rides - and fill your time with the smaller fun rides. I really enjoyed this park.',\n",
       " \"A perfect compliment to Disneyland! More modern aesthetic, good rides, great shows, and this side isn't suited as exclusively for kids as Disneyland.I got completely soaked on Grizzly river run, and really enjoyed Soarin'.World of colors and the Frozen performance at Hyperion were stunning, and can't be found in any other theme park to date. Very memorable, and not to be missed!\",\n",

Can't wait for our next visit !\",\n",

It looked just like Radiator Springs. Bugs Life and the Tower of Terror were the same as Disney in Orlando. We enjoyed the boardwalk and the arcade. The food was very good especially the Italian restaurant. My son especially enjoyed the Giradelli ice cream shop. It was the best $12 sundae ever!',\n",

       " \"For families with teenagers, I think this is a better park than Disneyland. The thrill rides are stomach-dropping but smooth. Even the rides that target younger kids are entertaining for older kids. This park is not as crowded as Disneyland. We loved the new Max pass option, which was being offered at an introductory rate of $10 per ticket at the time of this review. Absolutely worth it! We rode everything we wanted to ride, and rode some like Guardians of the Galaxy and California Screamin' more than once. World of Color was the perfect ending to a wonderful day. Well done, Disney!\",\n",

We ran to get our fast passes to ride the Carsland, Guardians of the Galaxy and Toy Story, but we also rode Mater's ride, the Dancing cars ride, the ferris wheel (non spinning), heimlich's adventure, the trolley, aerial's ride, Soaring, etc. We ate breakfast at Flo's and had the american breakfast (eggs were powdered) but the rest was good, ate at the Cove for lunch, had the lobster nachos, very tasty and had dinner in the Grand Californian at the Storyteller's cafe that has a buffet or order off the menu. We had a lovely time at California Adventure and enjoyed our time there. Do California Adventure first then Disneyland the next day!\",\n",

       " 'This park blew my mind - what fun we had. I love it how when they say the wait time will be 55 mins, the wait time WAS 55 mins for a particular ride. As a family of 4 travelling I always look for ways on saving money when going to these big parks so I packed a roll, piece of fruit and some chips for each of us, also a big bottle of frozen water. This saved us HEAPS of money, I \"splurged\" and got the kids some fresh water when we ran out and a bottle of coke (just to keep our sugars up!!) - and a couple of churros after our big ride on Radiator Springs at night - just because they had such a fabulous day.Another tip if you go in the middle of summer - take wide brimmed hats for your kids - we saw sooooooo many parents with small kids and no hats!!! That is insane - some of the lines have no shade or intermittent shade - I was so happy my kids had their heads covered.The only ride that we had such a long wait for was the White Water Rapids, but its quite an entertaining walk in the line and you get to chat to some nice people.The BEST ride at this park was Radiator Springs - it was absolutely AMAZING. I was super glad that we had done a Fast Pass for this ride, which we ended up going on at night - I would recommend that too. Once we had the Fast Pass organised we could then relax a bit and go on nearly every single ride. Its advantageous to download the free app which tells you the queue time at all rides - brilliant!!! As our RS Fast Pass wasn\\'t until 8:30-9:30pm time slot we did most of the ride in the day, went back to the hotel for a cool down swim and some dinner (saving costs there!!) then returned to go on the ride. As we weren\\'t really that interested in the fireworks (my 4 year old son doesn\\'t like the noise) when all the patrons were flooding out the front doors to watch them we scooted around and went on ALL the other rides - some we wouldn\\'t have bothered with but we were just in the flows of having fun at Disney and laughing the whole way around.It really was a special time for us all - it was a magical place.',\n",
       " \"Love this park! The themes, props and lands are spectacular. A lot of effort has gone into making this a fun & visually stunning park.We puchased a 3 day park hopper where you can go between Disney & California as many times as you please.They have a fast pass system which makes lining up much more tolerable.Just a mention, we tried to fast pass in Disney then went to California to get maximum rides in. You can't You can only fast pass one park at a time.There are shows throughout the day to keep you entertained. And different to Disney, there is alcohol allowed in this park so the big kids can have some fun too\",\n",
       " 'This was our first visit and we loved it. What a fantastic atmosphere this park has. We loved the theming throughout the whole park. The staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. This park is fully accessible for those in a wheelchair which is brilliant. You must watch The world of colour. We found this park had something for everyone, it has big thrill rides right down to learning to draw a character. We will definitely be back.',\n",

       " \"For those with older kids I'd recommend this over Disneyland next door as it caters for kids older than toddlers. Great rides (loved the Cars ride), good choice for food (had soup in a loaf) however a few of the rides were closed for maintenance but that's ok. In all I'd recommend going to Universal Studios as it's got more to do and it's more convenient to LA.\",\n",
       " 'This park is fantastic! The theming is amazing and there are a good selection of rides unless you are a real thrill seeker. There are lots of good food options, it is well laid out and easy to navigate. Arrive as early as possible to make the most of your day.',\n",

She also loved the swinging gondolas on the ferris wheel. Car's Land was great fun too. We really enjoyed everything that we went on and the atmosphere of this park. We didn't wait longer than 20 minutes for any of the rides. I would suggest going early to get a fastpass for the Car's ride and go on the water ride earlier in the morning. You'll also need a fastpass for Soarin' to avoid a longer wait time. We LOVED World of Color. The show was amazing. The best Disney show, by far. I wish they would bring that to Walt Disney World. We bought a dining package to get the preferred seating. It was well worth the price!!!! LOVED it!!!!!This park is great, especially if you are staying at the Grand Californian and can go through the back entrance!!!\",\n",
       " \"The park was very outdated for the price of the entrance. There are not that many rides and most of them are out dated. I went with my 10 year old son and 17 year old niece. The only thing we enjoyed was the Racers and Screams rides; everything else was for younger kids. The fast passes were not very useful and to allow one fast pass every two hours is just not right. The lines are super long and confusing. The staff is rude and not helpful. The park itself was not attractive and had this dingy dirty feel to it. It needs a modern update and more up to date attractions. The slow/baby attractions like the Golden Zephyr (slow rocket), Swings, Bug's life train, jelly fish jumpers, and carousel are just not worth the $100 plus entrance fee. Also, they sell souvenir cups but no free re-fill, which for most theme parks is the main selling purpose. I don't think they had any fountain drinks, all in a bottle, to get more money out of you. I was very disappointed and feel cheated out of a Disney experience. I expected more for the price. Would not recommend.\",\n",
       " \"There are some attractions here that appeal to adults - the new repurposed Tower of Terror - now Guardians of the Galaxy themed (one of the best attractions in the park). The Cars themed race attraction was also great. The Screamin' Roller Coaster and Mickey's Fun Wheel were also great. But I didn't feel like there was enough to entertain me for the entire day. If I didn't have a park hopper, I would have been bored.One huge plus - the World of Color Light Show was FANTASTIC!! It's every night at 9 and 10:30. The rides in this park close at 10pm tho (compare to midnight with Disneyland).\",\n",

I loved the souvenier shop we went into, every place I go I buy fridge magnets, they had shirts in my size which made me happy because Disneyland did not have my size. The man who waited on us at the Souvenier Shop was not only good at his job, he also recommended the ride Souring Over The World, I loved it. It is amazing how people have such Imagination to make something so amazing that you actually feel like you are soaring over the world.',\n",
       " \"This park is located onsite next to Disneyland and tickets can be purchased either as a single entry or as part of the Park Hopper with a Disneyland entry. In reality, it is its own park and requires at least a full day, if not several. This park continues to Disney theme, and has a lot more pixar based attractions. It doesn't have the same magical feel as Disneyland, but is still a lot of fun and a must do while visiting.Similar to Disneyland, there are numerous well presented attractions, characters walking throughout the park and lots of food/attractions on offer. The highlight for my children was the Art Academy, where you learn to draw disney characters with a studio artist in a lecture-theatre type setup. If you have to pick between the parks due to time or financial constraints, I would certainly recommend Disneyland. If you have the luxury of both, then check it out. Allocate and prioritise Disneyland if somewhere in between.All up, fun day and great park, especially when combined with a Disneyland holiday.\",\n",

When I returned in 2017 I was upset to see changes to the original rides and I do understand changes need to be made to update to accommodate the newer movies, but was disappointed that they made changes to original rides to update them, and not in a good way specifically It's a Small World, which I did leave a review for. I also understand breaks needed for characters, but when I wanted a picture with Winnie the Pooh and only Winnie the Pooh I was told I had to wait in the long line for Piglet the first time and then Tigger the second time to get to Pooh. I was unable to go straight for Pooh and was rudely told I could not take a picture just with Pooh and then when it was my time the lady said sorry you will have to come back in 30 minutes.

However a staff named ANDREW (a tall guy with dark skin, looks a Latin guy) asked me, \"Are you a single rider?\" and I said yes coz i\\'m riding alone. Then he forced me to get out of the line because he said that a single rider can\\'t choose their seat. I thought that was weird.Later I just knew about a single-rider waiting line rule. But I DIDNT QUEQUE FOR SINGLE-RIDER LINE. I USED FASTPASS! I feel so cheated.2. They should inform about the rules clearly. They confiscated my selfie stick. Even until today I never read about those rules. And it was weird because in the entrance when they checked my bag, they should have notice my selfie stick. I asked for a locker because I don\\'t want to throw them away since it was a birthday gift from my friend, they lied that there is no locker. Later on I figured that they have locker. However the guy who took my selfie stick were still nice and not rude like that Andrew guy in the California Screamin\\'.Also the car ride in Cars Land had problem when I came.

Radiator Springs Racers is one of our most favorite rides! Make sure you fastpass it though! California Screamin is a great rollercoaster! The Little Mermaid ride is great for young children or for anyone who wants an entertaining break in an air-conditioned area! The food options are great, the whole park is great, the parades are a must-see, and we have no complaints! Also, check out Grizzly River Rapids- it is our favorite for cooling off! Disney also did a great job with the new Soarin Around the World RIde- we miss the old California one, but we aren't disappointed in what it has become!

Carsland, the Toy Story shooting gallery, and Soaring to name just a few are our favorites. The one experience that made my visit was Goofy dressed as a movie producer skipping around the circle at the end of Buena Vista Avenue with little children holing his hand while they smiled to beat the band. This is what it's all about. Go Disney!\",\n",
       " \"I absolutely loved this park and my daughter did too. We had so much fun! The lines weren't as long and the park was less crowded than the Disneyland park. My daughter enjoyed all the characters she was able to meet and take photos with around the park. She loved cars land and a bugs land. The Disney Jr. Dance party was also a really good time. Customer service is fantastic, as expected! I booked our vacation package through Disneyland and it made everything very easy, the option to make payments is also pretty cool.\",\n",
       " 'Disney California Adventure Park is I think better than Disneyland itself - the streets are wider its less cramped and the Disney experience more upheld here than across the road',\n",
       " \"Disney really outdid themselves with the Cars Land and World of Color which is the water pyrotechnic show at night. Due to research I knew in order to get a decent view we needed a fast pass and it worked out well but we did line up 45 minutes early to get a front view for our section even though we had the blue pass. The World of Color show was phenomenal and not to be missed. We found this park harder to be efficient in than Disneyland as there are more big attraction rides spread throughout the park and not little rides to do while you are waiting on your Fast Pass return time in each area. Warning Fast Passes for Guardians of the Galaxy and Radiator Springs can disappear early. We were unable to get one for Guardians and I was so disappointed but after World of Color we made one last attempt to ride and were able to do so successfully with less than a 30 minute wait. The rest of the day the wait was over an hour. Rides like Soarin, Little Mermaid, Toy Story were just like Orlando. My youngest child enjoyed all the kid rides that resemble your state fair. Warning not to wait till late in the day to do the Ferris Wheel and California Screaming Roller Coaster because they close early before 8 pm due to the World of Color show. My families favorite ride was Radiator Spring Racers it's one of the best rides we've seen from Disney, so cute and fun but make sure you get a Fast Pass first thing extremely long wait times!!\",\n",

It was hot and it was busy; we were there in mid-July but it never felt annoying like crowds do in most other places. I feel like people were considerate and patient. The fast passes are the way to go when going on the rides. We enjoyed the Guardians of the Galaxy, Cars, Grizzly Peak, Splash Mountain and the Railroad! We recommend the World of Colour water show, which you can also get fast passes for ...the passes get you a section closer to the show. All in all, my expectations were exceeded!!',\n",
       " \"There is no other amusement park quite like Disneyland - though Universal Studios gets close. Learn about the fast pass system and get there early (or stay late from what I hear) if you want to go on a lot of rides. Bring a change of clothes if you plan to go on any water rides. Bring snacks in with you to avoid waiting in food lines. I miss the Tower of Terror ride - the new ride just doesn't have the same feel to it for me.\",\n",
       " \"We are huge Disney world fans but only had time to do Disney CA; and since we have teenagers we did this park. No matter which location, Disney truly is our happy place. Great memories from childhood movies and cartoons that come to life at the park!!! OMG..ride the Guardians of the Galaxy and Mater's Junkyard Jamboree!!!! But as usual the price of food is $$$$$....\",\n",
       " \"This park is like the newly updated version of Disneyland. It has marvel rides and characters and a real rollercoaster. The world of color was definitely magical and I would recommend getting a fast pass for it to guarantee you a spot near the front, because it doesn't interfere with your ride fast passes. All the cast members were so friendly and helpful.\",\n",
       " 'We had a great time this year. Not real happy with the new fast pass. For an additional $10.00 a person you can get all your photos and not have to go to the rides to get your fast pass you can just get it on your phone. We only paid for 1 just so we could have the photo pass. I know we went during peak season but overall we did get to go on all the rides with okay wait times. If you want to see the World of Color show you must get a fast pass for it otherwise you will be in the stand by section. We opted not to see the show. The new Soaring ride and California Screamin were are favorites. Be sure to go on all the rides in the show area early because they close some of them at 7:30 pm to prepare for the show. Overall we had a great time but be sure to bring extra cash for dinner.',\n",

Wish upon a star that Disney will add more healthy options to their market pop-ups, or walk up restaurants. That would be nice.\",\n",

       " \"I was there with a 9 and 10 year old. We loved the Fast Pass idea; we'd get a pass then jump in line for another ride and when we were done it was time to jump the line on the other ride. We got there right after it opened and still didn't have enough time to get to everything. The Guardians of the Galaxy line was so long, I doubt we would've made it before the place closed. They put a ton of attention to detail into everything there. Toy Story ride was a blast, but by far the longest line. I would recommend getting a fast pass for that one. Pretty expensive to go to but we all loved it.\",\n",
       " \"We had a day at Disney California Adventure Park in December. We were a large family group from seniors to young children. Overall we had a good day. The highlights were California Screaming, Radiator Springs, Toy Story Mania and Soarin. Despite being mid December the park was very busy. It also poured down for most of the day, so this tainted the day somewhat. We found the park a little less ' Disney' than Disneyland, or the parks in Disney World. This perhaps would have been less of a feeling had we had a dry day, with less time spent under umbrellas!\",\n",
       " \"As any resort and amusement park, Disney is expensive. I recommend if you are just around and shopping for gifts and souvenirs to instead save a different day to head out to the disney outlets either in south coast or any outside disney store. With that, meals are expensive as well; however Pacific Wharf has a good clam chowder bowl in a bread bowl for around 11, prices may have gone up, but it is pretty filling for 2-3 people on average. I recommend if you are going for a visit to arrive early to get fast passes for world of color and run to car's land radiator's spring.\",\n",

I believe since WDW has more space you don't notice the crowds as easy as you do at DL or DCA. The new Guardians ride had the longest wait. We heard straight there for a fastpass. Then we rode other rides until it was time for our FP. Once the ride was done we grabbed another FP for Guardians. The FP's were gone by lunch. We waited between 15-25 minutes in line for all other rides. Which is not bad at all. Most of them kept moving so it didn't feel like such a long wait. And there is plenty for all ages to see and do. I will definitely visit again.\",\n",

This is definitely the most popular ride in Anaheim and those passes are gone quickly!Then head over to Soarin and ride that - it's magnificent!Something else that we loved was the Disney Animation building. You might not even notice it in Hollywood land as there is so much to see! But this place is great. You can learn to draw different characters every hour (so much fun - we drew Zero from Nightmare before Christmas), meet Anna and Elsa, visit Belle's Library and find out which Disney character you are most like, and even chat with Crush from Finding Nemo. My daughter was chosen to talk with Crush and it was hilarious.A great time had in this park!\",\n",

The app will help you to plan and use your time wisely in the park. Get a FastPass for the World of Color show in the morning if you want a good spot, although people usually hold up their cameras and ruin your view even in the best places. I like to stand back by the shops to view it. The first show is usually more crowded. You cannot get the FastPass for this on your app, so check the handouts they give you for where to go to get it. I prefer the old Tower of Terror, but the new ride they changed it to is good too. The new \"Frozen\" play at the Hyperion is awesome!! I went twice! CA Adventures will not disappoint!',\n",
       " \"Disney California Adventure is a great park. The new Max Pass made it even easier to have fun! Cars Land is my absolute favorite land. We were there for the big Shaboom. It's an event I hadn't heard of before. It's when all of the lights are turned on. I'll never miss it again when I'm there. There are many unique shows and attractions. There are also lots of places to relax in out of the way spots when things get too hectic. Be sure not to miss the World of Color!\",\n",
       " \"Our grandkids love Disneyland so we spent one day of the three days they were there at both parks with them. I can afford the tickets but I have to say the prices are excluding a lot of young families. I don't think Walt Disney would really want that to happen. The better rides had wait times of 1-2 hours unless you went to the Single rider line which usually was a 20 minute wait. There was also an opportunity to get your ticket validated at the ride site that would punch in a time for you to come back and have priority. Still, the lines were too long and the waits excessive. I realize that it was the end of school recess so that may have been a factor. Disneyland's success has created a problem because the whole park was a mob scene with too many visitors. So on one hand I think the prices are really high(lemonade $5) but even at that the park is too crowded resulting in long lines. Parking at the self-park garage was $20 for the day. My wife has some back issues so we rented an electric scooter..a great idea if you don't want to walk 5-6 miles in the heat of summer. We ended splitting up the scooter to give each other a break. The price is $70 but you get $20 back when you turn it in. If you aren't a cross country runner or under age 60 I highly recommend the scooter. All in all it was good...but not great. Our grandkids thought it was great....and that is all that matters in the end.\",\n",
       " 'I traveled with my 9 yr old niece and we really enjoyed this park the most!! Make sure you use the Fastpass to help with the long lines. This park also has a back door over to the Disney Grand California Hotel and that is great after a long day of walking!! You want to make sure you see The World of Color. It is one of the best shows Disney does.',\n",

But, it had been at least 15 years since I had been to California, so we decided to take the kids to visit Disneyland. I mean- it\\'s Disney, so of course it was amazing! However, I was a little disappointed with some of the differences between California and Florida. The staff were not as \"happy\" & \"friendly\" as they are in florida. The estimated times on the rides were ALWAYS wrong. It the sign said 15 minute wait, it turned out to be at least 30-45minutes. We had a ride go down ( which I know happens), but there was no communication to us as to what was happening. Is it being fixed, or totally closed down, any idea how long it might take?? Nothing. I was not happy that we wasted a good 45 minutes on that. We did enjoy every ride, show, parade, and game. The food was also very good & we ate a few places throughout the day. The world of color light show was incredible. I\\'ve never seen anything like it. I was slightly disappointed, but as a Disney kid- I would still go back!!',\n",

Use the FastPass as much as you can but cannot get new FastPasses until you use your current ones, which can be a few hours after you receive them. My main issue is that in peak season the park closes at 10pm and many of the popular rides around the lagoon close even earlier due to the light show. Disneyland is open until midnight and I would have expected this park to be open at least until 11 and not close several popular rides down before an already early closing time.',\n",

Those rides are not as \"thrilling\" as other parks such as Six Flags but it sits comfortably between boring and \"lose your lunch\" rides. The live shows the park offers are second to none, \"World of Color\", \"Frozen\", \"Aladdin\" to name a few are some of the best audio-visual performances I have ever seen.

There are throngs of visitors and extremely long queues for each attraction. For some rides, the wait was a minimum 120mins. I think what upset me most is that you have to queue up whilst being baked in the sun. That drains you of your energy and irritates your patience. There are no shades for the queues. Not everyone will want to tan and the weather in Anaheim is quite hot between 10 and 3pm. I was most relieved when I got out of the theme park. Some lessons for everyone that is visiting:1. Obtain an official map of the grounds before you visit. 2. Map out which attractions appeal to you. 3. Assess if it makes sense to spend the extra fees to get a ticket which gives you fast pass privileges to skip the queue. 4. If you don't want to take advantage of #3, bring an umbrella, lots of water and a portable misting fan.\",\n",

We found this very worthwhile and is a fantastic idea. We used this every day and felt we got great value. The only negative point I would make is that the wifi in the park is awful - very temperamental and many areas of the park have no coverage at all.

Each exhibit was given proper space & carefully thought out so as to be educational as well as fun. In January I spent 2 weeks in Gold Rush Country, Calaveras Big Trees Park, Lodi, & the NW Coast & Seashore. I'm envious that Residents can take many short weekend trips & never get bored.\",\n",
       " \"Don't waste your time going in the summer or holidays. Way too many people. You won't get to ride many rides and experience the entire park. Very disappointed in the crowds. They should have a stricter policy on how many people are allowed in.\",\n",

       " \"We visited California Adventure the first week of March and had a fantastic time. In my opinion, Cars Land alone is worth the trip! The rides were so much fun and you really can't make better memories than those made at the happiest place on earth! :] I found that our wait times weren't too bad - oddly enough, the longest we waited in line was about 30 minutes and it was for Mickeys Fun Wheel! We were very bummed to not have been able to ride Radiator Springs Racers, but that was our fault for not arriving at the park early enough to score a Fast Pass. We knew that our child would not want to wait in 120+ minute line, as it didn't get any shorter than that the entire day. Paradise Pier was a ton of fun. There is so much to see and do, and it's a great spot for people watching. The entire park was wonderful - especially the cast members who went above and beyond to make our first trip special. We can't wait to come back and spend more than one day here!\",\n",

Using Fastpass we were able to get on most of the rides, although would've loved to spend more time here to explore the park a bit more as we combined Disneyland with Adventure Park in one day - just not enough time for both parks!\",\n",
       " \"Even with the fast pass system, you end up spending a great deal of time waiting in line than actually enjoying the rides. If you are looking to just stroll around spending money on terrible food and cheaply made merchandise, then, perhaps this isn't such a bad place. I have never regretted spending money on a trip to a theme park as much before. People were packed into the two parks like sardines, with hardly any room to move about, constantly bumping into one another. My previous visit to a Disney park was 4 years ago in FL, and I don't recall things being this awful. Perhaps my memory is failing me, or perhaps it's difference between Disneyland v. DisneyWorld? Not sure.\",\n",
       " \"Great fun! Get there when the park opens and get a Fastpass for Radiator Springs or Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout first. Then get one for World of Color. The World of Color Fastpasses do not count towards the one-at-a-time attraction Fastpass limit. If you're arriving from the north and/or parking at the Mickey and Friends Parking Structure, pre-order coffee and food at Starbucks at Downtown Disney on the Starbucks mobile app. Great way to get food as you go in and be able to hit the more popular attractions before they get too busy. If parking elsewhere the Starbucks option may still be good for you, it's just not as convenient as you most likely won't pass the locations where you can use the mobile app. But there is a Starbucks inside.Continue your day interspersing Fastpass attractions with those that do and those that do not offer it. Have lunch at Pacific Wharf for better-than-expected quick service meals, and make reservations for dinner (Wine Country Trattoria is great!). No need to do the World of Color dining package since you can get Fastpasses for the show and the dining packages usually have limited menus at higher prices.The Pixar Play Parade is not as popular as the parades at Disneyland Park but just as enjoyable. Look to snag a spot about 25 minutes before parade time on a normal crowd day.\",\n",

I love Disney & was nervous this park might lack the magic similar to all the other parks, However it exceeded my expectations! Cars land was amazing & the newly redone Guardians of the Galaxy ride was so much fun! The park does an excellent job making you feel as if you visited all of California in a day! In addition to my visit at Disneyland we also had the MaxPass which made our visit so much easier & enjoyable! Do the Radiator Racers first then GOTG Breakout next, Those 2 are easily the most popular! Don't expect to spend all day and night unless you have to wait in standby lines always. Overall we were very happy with our visit, and would gladly come back!\",\n",
       " \"We had lots of fun in Disney California Adventure Park, started with Cars land, which is incredible and brings the move scenery to life, the attractions there are also lots of fun.Guardians of the Galaxy has a huge queue, so take a FastPASS as soon as you can, otherwise the queue can get to more then an hour.In general, use the FastPASS for the main attractions, it can save up allot of time! it is free and the only limit is that if you already have a FastPASS for attraction, you can't take for another one while you are for the one you have.In several attractions, you will find the that FastPASS time is very close to the current time, and you don't have to wait for a very long time.We managed to get several times on attractions this way, and saved some times on the queues...\",\n",
       " \"With 4 kids aged 3-10, California Adventure can be pretty hard core. This is my plan of what to do.Basically when you arrive in the park, get your fast pass for either Guardian of the Galaxy or the Cars ride. These rides get super busy! Line up for the Cars ride and it won't be anymore than 20 mins if you're in the park early. We had a 3 year old that was 40 inches and border line for some rides. If this is you, and your child isn't tall enough, get a 'switch pass'. This allows you to come back later in the day at any time and go on the ride! We did this for a few ride and it allowed the older kids to go on rides that required an hour plus wait time in a fraction of the time.In the summer, take plenty of water with you! Yes you can refill at fountains but it tastes vile! Seriously, you can refill your bottle but dehydration seemed like a better option!As for other rides, just make sure that you get a fast pass. It's the fastest and easiest way! As for dining, some of the places can be pricey! Yes you've already sold a kidney to pay the park entrance fee and all the additional things can add up. We ate at on the peer! The food was good, it was sheltered from the sun and the kids food was reasonable. If you eat after 1pm, that's when I found these places the quietest.What else? During the Pixar parade, some of the rides are quieter so you can explore then. If you do like the Pixar parade, find a spot and sit it out as it gets busy quickly!Pace yourself! It can seem very intense but if you plan what you're going to do before you enter, it makes things easier!We loved California Adventure and I swear that if you hit those two rides early, the rest of the park is easier!I hope this helps!\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I seriously enjoyed this park! Cars land and bugs land are seriously immersive and detailed. We really liked it because it was unlike anything you can get at Disneyworld (which we've been to multiple times). Fun rides for kids and adults. Lots of characters to meet. This is the summer of heroes so you can meet some marvel superheroes. Also the groot bread is awesome. Only complaint is that you have to pay $10 to make fastpasses from your phone-they need to make it all free from phone or nothing from the phone because now you have to go to a kiosk and fast pass it and by 8am when it opens you'll still have to wait till almost noon. It's hard to plan your day. But other than that I definitely think it's the better of the 2 parks! We did everything we wanted in one day (but there was just 2 adults so larger families might need more time)\",\n",
       " \"For big fans of Disney movies, this is an excellent place to spend the day. Get the early hour access as this will pay out dividends as you have access to all rides with relatively short lines. Also try to grab your fast passes to your favorite rides as early as you can. Carsland is always at the top of our list here and can't get enough of riding Radiator Spring Racers. The movie set coming to life is just truly amazing. Also experienced the Guardians of the Galaxy ride and this is not for the faint-hearted. Bug's life area is good for the younger ones and don't miss the Disney Junior Dance Party which is a nice time to stay cool in the middle of the heat. Go to Hyperion to see Frozen Live!. Dine at Flo's V8 Cafe esp when those lights come alive at the dark. Get ready to get wet with Grizzly Peak and go flyin' with Soarin'. End the night at Paradise Pier with World of Color!\",\n",

It didn't disappoint! We visited with 2 kids (9 & 3) and found something to satisfy us all. We made use of the FastPass system and made sure we went on all the rides we could (suitable for our kids), but unfortunately it meant missing out on the Guardians of the Galaxy ride as the wait times were 70 - 90 minutes and there was no way we were going to wait that long in line!! The Fastpasses for this ride were gone by 10.30 for the whole day, so if you really want to go on this ride, get there early and head straight over to the ride and get your FastPass! The parade in the afternoon was one of the highlights for us as it featured all of the Pixar characters that we love, but overall it was a brilliant day and we can't wait to come back.\",\n",

Kids are miserable waiting 60-90 minutes per ride. I counted 56 - 68 Fast Passers to 7 -12 Standbys. Disney is in it for the money and not for the people who don't want to spend tons to jump in front of everyone else.

Strongly recommend use the fast pass, it will save you a lot of zig zag waiting line.we criss cross the park several round, my 11 and 13-year-old went along, we cover most of the rides. 9:00pm is the first-round water show... length 30 minutes. we did not get fast pass for that, next time, I will, it will have much better experience, we did not get there before the show to snatch a place, so we have to tip top and see through the crowd, it is hard for kids. after that we walked towards the entrance. and we saw the firework of Disneyland, when we exit the plaza, I did not pay attention and get to the side for shuttle bus, instead of the side of Disney downtown and tram. We had to re-enter the security, (tram people went thru security at the parking lot, while shuttle people went thru security right off the shuttle bus) go cross the plaza to reach the other side for tram. gosh, it is 10pm, the security person did not give me a break. thoroughly check my each and every bag. my gosh, they do have high spirit any time of the day.Overall, long line for all the popular rides, but no line for lame rides, some of the ride, when we do not have fast pass, we use single rider, also save a lot of time.

Learn about Fast passes and how they work before you get to the park as this can save you a lot of time.

We got there about 11 and our fastness was for 4:00. Since this is such a popular ride, they allow you to get another fast-pass within a few hours (we could get another one by 1:30). Despite the lines, we were able to get on every ride we wanted with the exception of the Radiator Springs Racers. Definitely recommend fast-passes for that ride; they run out early. If you can\\'t get one, do what we did and use the single rider option. It cut the wait time from 90 minutes to 25. We also did the World of Color dining package at Wine Country Trattoria. The pre-fix menu was $46/per person but included soup or salad, delicious entrees and dessert. You then received \"reserved standing area\" passes for either the 9:00 or 10:15 show. We chose the later show as this allowed us more time to experience the park (wait times for rides are less during World of Color).

Bugsland is for small children only. Carsland has the best 'dark-ride' between either park, but the rest of the land is nothing but black asphalt (theres a reason you dont like to stand in the street in summer), and gift shops.The down town city is just empty building devoid of function. The tower ride is nothing more than a standard carnival ride with some decoration in the line. The wooded area is by far the best done both in theme and in visual appeal, but only contains one good ride (water raft) and a walk through attraction. The Soarin' ride is a motion ride that uses very old, poor quality stock footage to jump-cut between aerial scenes of the state. Its boring, its ugly, and it still has a long line. The boardwalk is large and almost beautiful. It has a great roller coaster, ferris-wheel and carnival mania (video game/ dark ride) but the view of vast exposed pipes in the lake destroys the aesthetics. Given that it is located next door to, and cost the same as, Disneyland, (only with out the nostalgia, coherent themes or lack of drunkards stumbling around), it is beyond me why you would choose this park to spend any significant time at.\",\n",

       " 'Glad to see some new life into the park with the new Marvel characters a well as the new Guardians of the Galaxy ride which seemed to be a longer ride with more effects than the previous Tower of Terror! Had a good time regardless of the hot and humid weather.',\n",
       " \"Quick background: I grew up in Orlando, so I’ve been to WDW 100+ times, but never any other Disney parks until this recent trip. We visited Disneyland California and California Adventure, but I'll focus on DCA for this review. Overall impressions: My husband and I really enjoyed both parks, but we agreed that DCA was our favorite of the two. Best Rides:Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout! - We waited a solid hour for this one first thing at park opening, but it was totally worth it. (That said, I think next time we'll get a FastPass instead.) Be sure to watch the videos in the main area for a Stan Lee cameo. I honestly don't love the whole drop ride thing, but I loved watching the doors part and seeing what crazy antics were going on with each little scene. They did an excellent job with this. I wish we could have ridden it twice, but we didn't want to do the line again or use up a fast pass on it.All of Cars Land - I don't even really like the Cars movies, but this whole area was Disney theming at its finest. If you pass through during the day, make SURE you go back at night because it's even better. We loved the Radiator Springs Racers, which is basically a better version of Test Track from EPCOT in my opinion. Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters were ADORABLE. It was silly and there's not much to it, but damn if we didn't laugh and enjoy every moment of it.California Screamin’ – An excellent launch coaster that was way more fun than I expected. I wanted to ride it twice but we really didn’t have time.Honorable Mentions: Not a ride, but a thoroughly enjoyable experience was the World of Color night time show. It was beautiful and hit all the right sentimental notes.Lines and Crowds: We visited over July 4th weekend. DCA felt vacant, and we never waited in a line longer than 20 minutes, with the exception of Guardians of the Galaxy. Getting food was surprisingly painless. No long lines for food and no stalking tables to find a spot to eat. It was magical. My heart still belongs to WDW, because that’s what I grew up with, but DCA has some great unique elements worth checking out.\",\n",
       " 'It is a nice Disney park, there is no one like this in any place else. It \\'s nice to go with teens and friends that are ok with standing in line for a long time. You can buy a ticket the has a \"fastpass\" that is nice, because you can schedule your attractions and you don\\'t have to wait more than 10 minutes in line.',\n",
       " 'We loved CAP even more than Disney. I think because the themes of Toy Story and Cars were movies that my kids grew up with while some of the stuff at Disneyland was before their time. The Grizzly Peak area was also cool because we love the outdoors and national parks. All of the rides were a lot of fun and the light show at the end of the night was fantastic.',\n",
       " 'Plenty of places to eat as well as so many fun rides. My suggestion is to get there early to get fast passes for Guardians of the Galaxy, there was a line just to get them. Overall you know what you are getting with the Disney brand, Enjoy!',\n",

       " 'Went here with group of 8 (5 adults, 2 boys 9 & 11 yrs old, & a 3 yr old). Got in 30 minutes after opening and it was already crowded. We went straight for Guardians of the Galaxy and kids said it was the best ride in the park (as did numerous other riders). We also watched the \"dance off\" outside the ride. It was awesome! After that, it was tough to get on rides and the Fast Pass system is different than the one used in Disney World. We got to ride several rides, but couldn\\'t get on the Grizzly water ride or Soarin. The park was very clean as Disney theme parks always seem to be. And the food was really pricey. $40 for a medium sized pepperoni pizza is absurd. And bottled waters were $3.49. But you expect amusement parks to have way over priced food. The best attraction by far was the \"Colors of the World\" display at 9 pm. It was truly amazing! And then we watched fire works blowing off over Disneyland as we were walking out. If you stay to closing time, be prepared for utter chaos at the tram line to get back to the parking area. There were no marked lines or rails to line up in, and it was a free for all with much pushing, shoving, and attitudes. Getting out the garage was actually a breeze. But the kids enjoyed the rides and seeing all the characters too. The staff was very courteous and they were very responsive. Overall we had a really good time!',\n",
       " \"great park. It's Disney what more can I say. It's nice once you go throw security you can do both parks and Downtown Disney with out having to go throw it again.\",\n",
       " 'We were here with our 7 and 9 year old boys and loved it. We used the magic hour and had access to the park an hour before it opened to the public. we definitely used the fast pass system and avoided lots of long waits in lines. Our favorite rides were Guardians of the Galaxy, Cars and Toy Story.',\n",

Cast members delivered top notch service! I'd seriously live here!\",\n",
       " 'The rides here are great. You have thrills for the adventurous teenagers and fun rides for the little ones. We went in July and was afraid of long lines but they really never had insane wait times. The only drawback is that I wish they had more restaurants. You could get your food fairly quickly most of the times but finding a seat was usually difficult.',\n",

       " \"Loved CA adventure, it was my first visit. Recommend getting fast pass first thing to radiator springs. Color water/light show was amazing(worth the fast past) also worth getting on rides while the water light show is going on if you have a hopper for more than a day. The parks are so close together so changing parks are not a big deal. I loved tower of terror in Disney world, but guardians tower at the -land was a great mix of sci fi and humor. I enjoyed the theme/show and tower drops so much more as guardians.(I was a big fan of twilight zone reruns...my son thought the t-zone theme was scarier and the preloading for guardians more humorous). Drops and vid clips were awesome. California scream is the best dollar coaster I've been on, I went twice... loved the smooth ride (goofy's flight school scared me more with its small cars, tight corners and up high jerky turns, lol). Overall a great time at CA Adventure.\",\n",

There is plenty to keep your young children busy and happy between this park and Disney. Can get really busy so use fast passes and use rider switch if you have kids that can\\'t or won\\'t ride a ride.',\n",
       " \"I'm from the East Coast and had no idea this theme park was even a thing. The Cars Land area was amazingly adorable with really well-appointed details. I have no idea how they got the Mater animatronics on the Radiator Springs ride to look so real. Get a Fast Pass first thing in the morning. It was incredible!! We also enjoyed the italian dancing cars at Luigi's garage. So so so cute.\",\n",
       " 'My daughter was dancing in the parade here with dance the magic. This park is so much more open and spacious with crowds. We had no trouble finding a great place to sit to watch! Less stressful then parade day at DL park! I feel its more manageable to get to see the attractions here. Staying at the grand Californian also was a perk with the adjacent entrance/exit!!',\n",
       " \"The California Adventure Park is located just inches from Disneyland, although you need a separate ticket for each park or purchase a Hopper Pass which allows you to get into either park on the same day. The carnival like rides are amazing, with some actually situated over the huge lake that centers the park itself. The parades are the best we had ever seen, the Light Show in the evening was marvelous. It is held over the water, and when you stand close the water's edge you get wet with a light spray that feels good in the hot night air. The colors are AMAZING as they reflect off of the water. There are many attractions for ALL ages. The Ariel ride is colorful, slow, and no waiting in lines like at Disneyland. You walk into the ride , you get right on in minutes. The Yosemite look alike park area is a must see with zip lining for kids, climbing ropes for all ages, paths to walk under the cool forest trees. If you are lucky you get to see Chip and Dale and take photos with them. This area is laid back and such a refreshing spot for such a busy vacation. There are restaurants for meals, spots to purchase drinks throughout the park, there are water rides which do have long lines but you can do fast passes. The very best ride in the park is Soaring Over the World and we went on it TWICE. It is absolutely amazing doesn't drop you isn't crazy up in the air and even people with heart trouble could go on this ride,,it is worth the long wait in line.. Don't miss this ride if you visit the park.. You will be so happy you did!\",\n",
       " 'This is a great addition to the Disney property. We spent one day there with our son, daughter-in-law and their 6 year old. Lines moved quickly wait times were posted. The first rides we did were the ones we expected would have longer lines as the day went on. Disney has mastered the art of 3D and 4D rides. We did not stay in the park late enough for the World of Color evening light show, but I have since watched it on You Tube and would definitely make plans to see it on our next visit.',\n",

Park was very clean.Our third day we had a hopper pass so we did the rides we liked the best again at both parks.\",\n",
       " 'This was a \"must\" for our son\\'s family in their Disney / Universal trip since \"Cars\" in our grandson\\'s favorite. The Cars area and in particular the race cars through the simulated desert was great. I enjoyed the big roller coaster with my son, while the little kids enjoyed many of the other rides. We were a little disappointed in the large Ferris wheel because of the shortness of the actual ride. It took forever to load and unload. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the water / fire / laser \"Wonderful World of Color\" in spite of the little ones being exhausted at the lateness of the hour after a full day in the park.',\n",
       " 'Took my family of four small children here and had a great time. The cars ride is hands down the favorite of the kids. Soaring over the world was amazing.',\n",

It lasted 20 minutes and was spectacular, would choose it over a lot of the other \"shows\" you can catch while at Disney. Favorite ride was the Mater one in the Cars area of the park, but I\\'m not a thrill seeker at all. My students loved the rollercoaster and the ferris wheel was a fun time too (can choose the swaying option or stationary car).',\n",
       " 'The California Adventure park is for entertainment and is pretty good. However, just like Disneyland, it also behind times. Again, there are no charging stations or even one place to re-charge your phone or devices. Food and drinks are more available than at Disneyland but still very expensive. The rides are good and the waiting times not too long. A better option but much smaller than Disneyland.',\n",
       " 'we went here for a family time for the most parts the place is very over crowded and almost impossible to move around lines were very often over a hour my family still enjoyed themselves here much more than at Disneyland the new ride soaring over the world was one they really enjoyed and of course cars',\n",

Found good good at two quick serv locations: boardwalk pizza and Pacific grill. Don't ride the gun eheerl if line is longer than 10 to 15 minutes it is not worth your time overall we had fun.

The rides are brilliant Radiator Springs Racers, Soarin, Luigis dancing cars, grzzly river run are just a few to name. It was with sadness that we said goodbye to The Tower of Terror which is a great ride and is to be replaced by Marvel clone Gaurdians of the Galaxy. The park has a great selection of food from fast to restaurant standard. Overall a great park well worth the visit time after time',\n",

It is full on senseorama activating all your senses... visually outstanding... smell wise unbeilevable....hearingwise just great.The ride is second to none in full on experience....

The Radiator Springs Racers is the best ride ever! The Gaurdians of the Galaxy attraction is awesome and Grizzly River Run is the best raft ride in the world! Fabulous eats and roller coasters. This is just simply the best park! So worth the $ and travel!\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I were very excited to visit California adventure as last time we were here parts were still under construction and we didn't have a lot of time there. This park does not disappoint! My husband felt it caters better to adults than Disneyland does with some of the rides being a bit more 'thrilling' Carsland was the highlight for both of us. As soon as you step into radiator springs, we were instantly transported into the movie! It is simply incredible. We had been given the tip to head straight for the card ride as the line can get pretty big. We are so glad we did as it was an hour wait but woah was it worth it!! Such a great ride! Our favourite of the whole park.The world of color show is a must see. Get there early to get a good spot. Absolutely breath taking show. Had me in tears by the end. Overall I think Disney California adventure is a must visit, my husband preferred it to Disneyland but as a die hard Disney fan, I can't get over the magic and nostalgia of Disneyland.\",\n",

If you have to chose between one or the other and you're in the 'little bit older' age category, we'd both recommend C.A. Both parks are a lot of fun, but the rides at C.A. are gentler. The roller coaster is a blast. Soar Over California merits several waits in line. The Cars racing ride was great. We loved Tower of Terror but heard it's no longer there. Anyway, that's my two bits. If you have young children, I think they'd probably prefer Disneyland.\",\n",

Visually, I found the park to be very nice. Cars Land and Paradise Pier in particular looked gorgeous at night. From a ride perspective, though, I didn't find very much we wanted to stand in line for. My youngest loved The Little Mermaid and the merry-go-round. My oldest loved the pizza and The World of Color show. We wanted to ride Soarin' and Radiator Springs Racers, but the lines were long and we had things to see/do at Disneyland that took precedence. Many other rides we just passed on by because we were just not interested enough to even give them a try. Still, I thought this was a very nice park and had I had more time (or time without the kids) I would have tried to ride all of the more exciting rides. I wouldn't visit Anaheim just to go to California Adventure, but it is well worth a visit in conjunction with Disneyland.\",\n",
       " \"Even with the busy crowds of summer vacation this place is still amazing. It's like walking onto a movie set when you step into Radiator Springs. The keys to get the best out of the place are to have a multi day pass and to really utilise the Fast Pass system, especially for the Guardians of the Galaxy ride (which is totally awesome) or Toy Story Midway Mania. If you are also prepared to use the single rider option you can quickly get to the front of the queue for many of the popular rides. My adult daughter and I easily got around everything we wanted to more than once by utilising this system. Be warned though that quality food is sparse, so you may want to stock up before you come to the park. There are lockers you can rent to store things in for the day.\",\n",

I was not the only person caught out. This is something you need to be aware of regarding \"Fast Passes\". The up shot is that if you speak to the people at the Information Booths they have the ability to upload \"Fast Passes\" to your tickets for both Disneyland and California World which can save you some time for the rides.

The midway area only has one thing little kids can do, so we didn't go to that area at all. The Ariel under the sea ride was excellent. We enjoyed that three or four times. Only thing I could say about California venture that isn't fabulous is that it's difficult to find shade sometimes.If you had to choose between Disney and California adventure for young kids, Disney clearly is the choice. For the older crowd California adventure has some wild rides that are a blast. And don't miss the nightly show of colors. It's movies and pictures set to music played on water.

It thrilled me to see old Hollywood from the 20\\'s to the 40\\'s replicated like old movie sets. The ride Soaring Over California was an experience I wanted to relive over and over because it\\'s a sensory thrill that tickles all your senses. I loved the John Muir forested area that is so much a part of this great state. Children were hiking and climbing through the trees like peripatetic adventurers. Thinking this was all enough for a great park, I was deposited into a midway amusement park with the likes I had never seen before. This area has all the scary rides of your youth when you walked hand-in-hand with your sweetie wanting him to win you a stuffed animal. There are many rides for ages 0 to 100 and wonderful eating venues. I haven\\'t even talked about the great rides, but just know there is something for everyone.

       " \"First get there early. There are now new security measures in place including metal detectors, and apparently some people think they can walk through a detector with 20 Disney pins on a lanyard. 2 things Disney Parks do better than any other Park, line control and food. We were at the Gate at 7:00 AM. at 7:30 they let us in. We were instructed to go down through Hollywood for the new Guardians Ride. We were met at rope by 2 Park employees with a Sign saying fast pass.We were one of the first which is good. The line went from Turtle Talk with Crush back to the main square. We were escorted to the fast pass ticket distribution center where another Disney employee was making sure no one tried to cut ahead of the line. At 8:00 am Sharp we were allowed to get our fast pass. I say this because at another Park in the Hollywood area this would have been an uncontrolled crush of people. Our fast pass was for 8:30 we got another for Radiator Springs Racers at 9:30. The Guardian's ride is really cool but won't ride it again, I don't have the stomach for it. Learn how to use the Disneyland App and the fast pass system. Some rides have an hour wait but almost immediate entry with a fast pass. All them parks have expensive food. Disney food is at least worthy of the Price. At a Pacific Wharf and Flo's diner. Both do not disappoint. Make sure you find the Gharadelli chocolate store and fountain and the back of the park.\",\n",
       " \"It might be heresy but I like Disney's California Adventure (DCA) more than Disneyland (DL). Maybe it's because I'm old(er) and I've been to DL enough that it's not surprising to me anymore. Also, DL is usually busier with many more smaller kids. It's charming for sure, and is a great time, but...DCA has one of the best Coasters in the US (California Screaming), and a water rapids ride that's super fund. One a hot day, it really can't be beat. (Although Splash Mountain in DL is the best ride of both parks). DCA is more spread out thanks to its modern design, and .. well, you can get beer, wine and alcoholic drinks there. I don't drink a lot, but I love a lite beer in hot weather and I like a good whisky drink before dinner. Neither is possible in DL. Of course, both parks are great. But if you have one day, kids 10 years old or older, and you don't want to buy a park hopper ticket - then I recommend DCA over DL.\",\n",

Downtown Disney is at the entrance of both parks. There are several restaurant options. It's a safe environment with teenagers and parks are connected so the older kids can choose where they want to go with Disney app and Park Hopper passes.\",\n",

He was a huge Cars fan until that one ride, and after that he wouldn't go near it and didn't even want a Cars tee shirt. Luckily he loved Luigi's Rollikin' Roadsters and so did the adults in our group. It's a lot more fun than it looks. Paradise Pier was our favorite part of the park. The Silly Symphony Swings are the best although the seats are a little narrow. Mickey's Fun Wheel is a great way to see the sights from high above the ground. There are swinging and non-swinging cars (we chose non-swinging for a more sedate experience). Don't miss the World of Color spectacular at 9:30 pm. Absolutely breath-taking.\",\n",

If you don't know about Fastpasses, learn before you go: saw people stuck waiting in line while we rode some attractions three times. Also, if you are on a budget, bring your own food--no big coolers/glass etc., but a soft sided cooler bag is not an issue.\",\n",

January 2018 was listed as a quiet time in the parks - even with our early magic hours to gain access from 9am - the queues were so big outside - we didn’t enter the park until 09:50am which was a shame. Main Street was actually boarded up straight from the entrance to the castle. This was also unexpected and didn’t allow us to get the photo pass pics we wanted. We have been to Paris and Florida in the last x2 yrs so wanted to get the same pics on main st. Next time. I recommend queuing at city hall (guest services) to get free badges - ‘MY FIRST VISIT’ etc. The park was spotless. Specialty treats & Disneyland only merchandise. Classic rides - Peter Pan, Pinocchio, dumbo (closed), big thunder mountain, space mountain, it’s a small world, mr toad, haunted mansion etc. Great fun. Specialty dining was worth the extra $. Photo pass was a much better offering than at DLP. A marching Disney band relaxed the Main Street parade. No fireworks. A good visit - but a bit of Disney sparkle lacking. Florida customer service still has the excellent record compared to other parks. Take plenty of £€$ - you will need it',\n",

Of course the parks and property are smaller than Disney World but we had an amazing trip. Would definitely recommend staying on property if possible because of the convenience. Unfortunately the week of our trip all of Main Street and the storybook canal boat ride were under construction. I understand sometimes attractions are closed for refurbishment but the whole length of Main Street at one time seemed a little excessive and took away from the magic slightly especially being our first trip.',\n",

Fun show, they grabbed some people from the tables to join the show, so be warned if you side down front.

I was very disappointed that we weren’t aware before we went that the whole Main Street was boarded up therefore no parades or fireworks at night. :( Apart from this we had an amazing couple of days and came home with some wonderful memories.

Adventure Park: maybe 4 rides for people over the age of 7 and the waits for those rides were rediculous (1.5 - 2 hours). Many of the rides were closed or broke down during our visit. Next day at Disneyland, again rides closed, long waits, rides breaking down left and right and way too many people! We should have been told more about the parks when we purchased the tickets or even when I called in advance to ask questions. One park is primarily for little kids and the other, unless you pay for the Fastpass app and figure out how to use it quickly, don't waste your time or money going here. I personally cannot ride any rides due to medical issues, but still had to pay full price (rent for the space I took up while standing for hours waiting, possibly??)\",\n",

The main street is under construction which made for a lot of congestion and the queues for the rides was never ending and then sadly the rides fell well below expectations. We visited the park again on the Wednesday and the crowds were reduced minimally but made for a lightly better experience but again the rides are a huge disappointment compared to a lot of the rides at other parks around the world. We enjoyed California Adventure Park a lot more and would recommend spending your time there.I was disappointed that you hardly got to see any of the Parks Characters and when we finally did see Mickey the lady had cut off the line so we missed out on a photo with him. Never saw any Disney Princesses over the two day period which again was a huge disappointment.The reality of Disneyland is over priced food, poor - average rides and lots of standing around in queues. The free Fast Pass every 2 hours worked good and that saved us a long wait on a couple of rides and we had downloaded the Disney App to be able to see what the wait times were around the park, so I definitely suggest you download that.Pack plenty of food and snacks/water in your back pack so at least you can eat while standing in the long lines!',\n",

Rides weren't that great, we saw one character in the park the whole time, the park was mainly just souvenir shops and restaurants at overcharged prices. No fireworks. No parades. Nothing that I imagined at all. The entertainment at the saloon was boring and slapstick and I am a professional performer. Waste of over 200 dollars. Truly disappointed in Disney, it just felt like a money making machine. The runaway train ride which I begrudgingly lined for hours as I knew it was a worse version of a great one we have at Alton towers at about 30 quid for the day! Don't even get me started on Space Mountain!\",\n",

Ticket machine jammed at entry to the park; I understand these things happen, but it took almost 20 minutes to get sorted2.

The 3 times we went to use the fastpass the Rides were not working because of mechanical ChallengesSo basically we paid extra for fast pass and it was never used and actually irritating',\n",

February is their winter, a great time to go as the lines are only 10-20 mins long. the weather cool but the sun warm. t-shirt and jeans each day and no issues. There was renovations on a few things but the entire park was amazing. the service, the smiles the rides all of it. Favorite ride........Starwars 4d experience and space mountain, i dont normally do rides but these two blew all my senses. most hated ride \" pirates of the Caribbean\" and the haunted mansion. the pirates ride was a hour wait most times, after arriving early one morning and lining for 10 mins we went on it. dont get me wrong amazing inside the ride, but if i had of waited any longer than 10 mins i would of been so angry. same deal with the Mansion ride. disappointed after waiting so long.Minne & mickys houses where a treat and very cool. As are the characters themselves, it was a family treat for us all to meet them. We had a 3 day park hopper and we covered all we wanted. we did 2 days Disney and 1 day 2 nights at the adventure land park. if you love rides you will need more time, but dont forget to stop and look at the park and its facade too. at night Disney streets are so stunning. the park was a dream come true, just dont spend all your time lining up for rides there is so much to see and enjoy that doesn\\'t involve a line.Shopping there was amazing, but be prepared to blow your budget. i had one teen and the star wars shop alone cost me. Not extremely expensive, but so much to choose. WE looked around and left the shopping for the last day to ensure we got what we wanted and thought it over for a day or two before spending on ever thing.even if you only do this once in your life, it is well worth it.THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH FOR SURE !!!',\n",

Stop at the city hall to get a map that tells you which rides you go to the exit. Once at the exit they will give you a return time to come back and ride the ride...kind of like a fast pass. We didn't find out until the last day you can have a fast pass AND a return time at the same time. We were helped by cast members at every ride because she couldn't do stairs and they gave her extra time to get into and out of the rides without being rushed. The classic rides are at this park and new ones are coming. When we visited some attractions were down (splash mountain) and they had the entire main street half blocked. It made it very difficult to navigate scooters and strollers through this area. We have been here many times and love this park.

Go on other rides in the area and come back at the time shown on your fast pass and enter through the fast pass entry. As soon as you use the fast pass, get a fast pass for the next FP ride.

I strongly recommend using the app prior to attending the park just so you can become familiar with the app. It has a map of both parks, tells you the wait times of rides, your tickets are saved on the app, character locations, restroom locations, guest services locations and you can fastpast from the app so you don’t have to walk to the ride to get your fastpast!!! You can also make reservation from the app which was so clutch!!! If we didn’t have the app my sons first experience would’ve been a huge disaster!! Download that App!',\n",

Even going in the off season during the week it still seemed really crowded with the center ofMain Street barricaded down the entire length of it.

       " 'I am so bummed that our Disneyland trip was sub par. Many parts of the park are closed, including the main st...this is located at the main entrance point of the park and one of the most iconic sections. Large walls lined both sides of the road, forcing patrons to choose which side of main st to walk on. It also caused congestion and took away from the charm of the park. Not to mention the walls were so tall and took up main st from start to finish, you couldn’t even see the Walt Disney statue or castle. Splash Mountain was also closed as they were doing work it. Additionally, parts of Small World and Fantasyland were closed. To be honest you could tell the whole park is going under a revamp. This is something Disney did not explain before going. A part of me feels like we were gipped out of the true experience. I wouldn’t pay to go here until all of the work is complete. I’m sure it will look great in the future but it was very much a let down as I know what the park could offer if all it’s sections were opened. And Disney, if you read this, don’t cheat your customers, let them know about these things ahead of time.',\n",

The exciting new thing was seeing the construction of the new 14 acres addition of the new Star Wars Galaxy\\'s Edge to be open in 2019.One thing I would like to add is during our time at the park I accidentally left my back pack in Tomorrow Land and didn\\'t realize it for two hours. Panic set in because it had my wife and daughter\\'s IDs, credit cards, and cash in it and I could not remember where I had left it. After about an hour search and a lot of help from the Disney staff, we found my back.

The night time lights show gets very crowded however, so make sure you get there early to get the fastpass for this.The surprisingly good Matterhorn Bobsleds was one ride that we enjoyed more than we thought we would. Space Mountain was amazing as well, but some of the other ones like the Star Wars and Buzz Lightyear rides, were ones you only had to do once.Indiana Jones was good fun.The only ride closed while we were there was the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which we'll have to catch next time.There also seemed to be a lot more characters & princesses in this section of the park, which was great for the kids.We were there during the Halloween period, and they did a great job of dressing everything up.

When we were there and they said til spring time, so something to keep in mind if you go in the next couple months. The main street is blocked off with construction. There are no parades at this time or fireworks with the castle. Knowing this before you go will help with decisions and experience. We did not know this and was a little disappointed when seeing it. However it did not ruin our experience. We had a very fun time! Spent the day. We even did a fantasmic dining package. I highly suggest.

The Indiana Jones Adventure broke down as we stood at the turnstiles to board the ride on the morning. It broke down again when we were getting ready to head back for our Fast Pass reservation near the end of the evening. Most of Paradise Pier was under construction and it’s impossible to get a reservation at a restaurant in either park. When you do, they cancel it without notice (see my review on Wine Country Trattoria). In all, for the $150 price of admission completely not worth the headache. Also, you should have left Tower of Terror alone. I love Guardians of the Galaxy and the video component is gray but ToT was very special. Guardians is just ok.

Why would they close the Ferris Wheel and the roller coaster at the same time?? We spent good money to travel there feeling like we wanted more out of our experience than we had.

The wait times weren’t too long. 20-30 minutes. Even still, we waiting that long to get on to a ride that is really just a parade for a movie that was released years ago. The Park was under construction. I don’t really care about that part. The park was clean and the staff was friendly. The food was not memorable. When it comes time to eat, either bring your lunch from home or go to Downtown Disney. It is a nice perk that they allow you to bring in your own food. We also like they they would give you free water cups with ice upon request. I would be just fine if I didn’t come back to Disneyland. There isn’t anything here that is worth what you pay for.',\n",
       " 'We went to Disneyland for two days in late Jan / early Feb and it did not disappoint. Top highlights include: the character breakfast at the Plaza Inn, the classic Haunted House and Pirates of the Caribbean rides, the recently updated It’s a small world ride, and finally the numerous character meet and greet opportunities. During this trip, we brought along our 2.5 yr old toddler so we did slant towards the more child-friendly rides. However, the new Disneyland app meant upgrading to Maxpass for ease of booking Fastpasses and keeping unlimited digital photos very worthwhile. We were able to go on more adult themed rides and switch on and off thanks to the convenience of the Fastpass and Rider Switch option. Regarding the character breakfast, it may seem expensive, however it meant we were able to take pictures with at least six characters while eating and this not have to spend twenty minutes or more lining up for each character in the park. There are dozens of characters in the park, so reducing the number of characters we had to line up for meant more time for rides. Additionally, if you go for the breakfast charger meal, the Mickey Mouse waffles are quite excellent. If you are willing to sit down for lunch, the monte cristo sandwich in the New Orleans area is very worth it! The kids meal at Cafe Orleans is also very sizeable and has many healthy fruit and vegetable options. Regarding renovations, while we knew this was a period of time in which some rides would undergo renovations and would this be closed, we didn’t anticipate that the entire streetcar rail system on Main St was also going to be under renovation. This resulted in the whole centre section of Main St being boarded up and left the area rather cramped. Some of the rides in the park were definitely showing their age as we had three cases in which rides broke down and we had to vacate them. These rides included: the roger rabbit ride in toon town, the Pinocchio ride, and the snow white ride. Finally, some of the older rides are not as small children friendly as you might think. In particular, the Snow White, mr. toad, and pinnochio rides were all very dark and mainly featured more of the scary scenes than memorable ones.',\n",
       " 'First time here at Halloween and it was great! Very very VERY busy. Take advantage of early hours and bounce between parks.

We only encountered one staff member who was a bit abrasive when we explained our troubles but then offered us some fast passes to compensate.',\n",
       " 'Most expensive place on earth! Paid over $4000 for 3 nights at Disneyland Grand Californian, 2 day Park passes for 3 people (two adults one toddler). Bought the max pass in addition and ate every meal on premises. Extraordinarily expensive and low value. There were 5 rides broken throughout the Saturday Feb 10 (Snow white, Pinocchio, Star Wars, Roger Rabbit, Small World) that we know of. This causes the lines at working rides to double/triple in length. Received Bonus multi fast pass on app because one of the rides was broken. Nice! But Wanted to use it at Small World and told we couldn’t because the fast pass machine was broken!! At every turn, even when Disney tried to make it right, it failed. Also, Disney won’t tell you the ENTIRE railway system on main street and castle area is 100% under construction across the park so the crowds have no where to go. There is no mention of this at time Of booking with the Disney travel agent by the way” and they charge you the same. January is typically construction time but it’s now mid Feb. Unacceptable. The staff were average at best as even said to us “we are breaking down”. Ate character breakfast at Park with Mini, made reservations, etc sat us in corner, no one cleared our plates until we were 100% done, and food was greasy and low quality. Disney will gladly take your money, treat you average and not tell you they should discount their prices because they sell something that is subpar. Their Tomorrowland is 1970’s Star Wars. The submarine ride is 1970’s 20,000 leagues under the sea now with Nemo holograms. Old. But if they were to improve something, they should invest more money in their app. We still had paper/plastic tickets and none of our stay was linked to the app automatically. It should all be automated! Systems are not talking to each other and it shows. Not seamless. They are running an average operation at best and over selling it based on their reputation. Disney corporate should take note of the poor reviews on Trip Advisor. I don’t even see any comments fromDisney management on Trip Advisor explaining the situation. So, sorry, but the Disney magic is gone for me in California. My recommendation is to look for another park or another vacation location to spend your hard earned dollars. Disneyland lost its luster and its simply not worth the money anymore. The park is aging and it needs a major redo to keep up with the times. Walt would be disappointed. Maybe try Florida.',\n",

You can take a look at this ahead of time on Disney’s website though.',\n",

Why would anyone wait in line if they could avoid it?Always get to the park early, the touring plans in the guide will set it out for you.I took my two kids, one 19 years old daughter and my six year old son. We haven’t been since my daughter was 6. So much has changed. One of the things we noticed the revamp of the rides and it was for the better, but made me miss the originals Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse is now Tarzan too Also, the Peter Pan ride broke down at least twice, Toad’s Wild Ride did too. The line for Peter Pan was over 35 Mins all day long maybe a Fast Pass is needed to be implemented for this... Also the line for characters never below 30 Mins. Crazy. We didn’t want to wait in any character lines if we paid well over $100 a ticket! No way!Another thing we both noted is the friendliness of the people that worked there. I rarely saw a smile or even an acknowledgement of my son wearing his “1st visit” pin. Actually only one cast member said something about it. The ones we did encounter were kind of grouchy. We had a very expensive lunch at the New Orleans area with a horrible tasting shrimp po’boy where I asked for ketchup for my son’s chicken, and they rolled their eyes. I then went back out to the cart where five people pointed, and went back inside and told them no that’s tobasco, so someone came and pulled it out from under the cart. I am a happy, nice person from Texas and to experience lack of warmth and I guess just overall lack of helpfulness is strange.All in all, we had a good time.

       " 'I have dreamed of visiting Disneyland ever since I was a little girl! My husband and I have recently travelled from Australia to go & whilst we loved each bit - I cannot give it 5 stars for a few reasons! First being, so many rides were closed! Including the iconic big white roller coaster in the ‘New’ California Disneyland. Being a low season, I imagine the crowds were smaller than usual, but the park was still very crowded and line times on most rides were 30-60min wait times. I’d hate to see it during peak season! In saying this, we do plan to one day return in peak season (so we can bring our one day children & go on all the rides without them being closed down!). But two words for anyone planning to go at any time of the year - FAST PASS! Not sure how much extra they are, we didn’t bother getting one because most of the rides we wanted to go on were closed. But it’s my hot tip (along with getting a park hopper ticket, so you can visit both parks). Overall, we had a magical experience! Loved it & can not wait to one day return.',\n",
       " 'A lot of people wrote reviews of Disneyland. This one is for anyone accompanying kids with special needs. As soon as you enter the park, go to City Hall and register the party for Return Passes. Usually one person per party has to be the carrier of the Return Passes but you can have them designate another person if your party plan different attractions. You can combine Return Passes with Fastpass so you can maximize your visit. There are 5 spots around the park marked with green umbrellas where you can reserve the attraction with Return Pass. They give you a return time usually better than the Fastpass, you go then to the attraction and use either the exit (for Pirates of the Carribean) or the Fastpass entrance. Once you’re done with the ride, you can book the next ride with Return Pass. Beware that you can’t book more than one ride at a time with Return Pass. But, as I said before, you can combine it with Fastpass. So if you do a little planning ahead (and use the app that shows you wait times) you can actually do a lot of rides with minimum wait time. My advice is to start with Tomorrow Land since Star Tours fills up pretty quickly. We’ve done this a few times and always ended up doing much of what we had planned to do.',\n",

       " 'What can anyone say about Disneyland?A visit is a must.Truly magic.You should be there early so you could enjoy all attractions before it becomes overcrowded.Ticket for adults costs about $100.A whole day there is necessary to see it all.If you have ever visited another Disneyland (e.g Eurodisney)it is recommended to visit Disney adventure park instead of Disneyland.',\n",
       " \"Disneyland has always been overpriced but it's fun, I suppose. If we didn't have kids I probably would never go back because it's such a huge waste of money. The kids who work the rides are friendly for the most part and the food is mediocre. It was insanely crowded the last week of January. I can only guess that was because of the unseasonably hot weather. All in all, overcrowded no matter what time of year, overpriced for what you get, and the food is overpriced and underwhelming.\",\n",
       " 'Always enjoyable. Although the crowds (year round) have increased substantially. There used to be seasons that were better for you to visit without larger crowds. Our experience has always been with polite CMs (staff), and a clean environment for the most part. Unfortunately some people don’t know how to clean up after themselves, and leave messes for already busy staff to clean. Most people are happy to be there... some people have been there too long, LOL. Their kids have drained them and their patience. (We always find it a good idea to go to your room and nap/rest in the afternoons.) It is a fun place to go escape the real world for a little bit and connect with your inner youthful self. But it is important to remember there will most likely be a LOT of people there with you, so pack those extra patience in that suitcase along with everything else.',\n",
       " \"We spent three days at Disneyland and California adventure park and 'almost' did all the rides. There really is a lot of information on the internet about how to 'do' Disneyland and we read quite a bit of it. The 'tips' that worked for us mostly related to using fastpass. Though it must be said that fastpass can be a nuisance if you end up with a late return time for an attraction which we did on one occasion as you can't get another fastpass in the same area until that one has been used. We also used 'magic morning' to our advantage by going straight to the fastpass line for Radiator races, meaning we avoided a long queue later in the day as fastpasses ran out and the standard queue got long.We are told that we went at one of the quietest times for disneyland, hence the longest we waited was around 40 minutes for the Indiana Jones ride. We noted that from mid-afternoon the crowds grew and the lines subsequently increased.Food was as we expected, expensive and some areas of the park seemed to have very little choice. Toontown was very short on food options.Merchandise was equally expensive - they certainly make their money on the likes of mouse ears at $25USD.We managed 90%+ of the rides but we didn't do any of the shows, so there is a bit of a tradeoff. My sister and her family went to quite a few of the shows but did hardly any rides - so each to their own.So what would we tell others? 1) buy a lanyard for your ticket outside of the park - they were a horrendous price inside disneyland.2) ask for water at the restaurants, to save on fizzy.3) my wife took a camelbak filled with ice and water that she used each day.4) Try everything - you may as well do a ride, rather than walk past one - thinking you might do it later.5) Buy your merchandise somewhere other than disney - our hotel had a large selection of disney gear, all cheaper.6) Don't go home before dark - the park really is magical at night with all the lights.7) There were no parades or fireworks whilst we were there - they don't start until April and they are apparently amazing.8) The guardians of the galaxy ride was the tower of terror - wish I'd known this before we went on it ; )9) If you need help - ask. All the staff we talked to were super helpful. We had my mum with us, who is in a wheelchair - staff went out of their way to make things easier for her when and where it was possible.10) if you are from overseas as we are, stay from dawn til dusk because it is the experience of a lifetime and one that will most likely never happen again.\",\n",

It was an adventure world for us, quite fascinating. We got a booklet of tickets, which we could use.

I did see others with tripods/monopods for their phones and go pros. I just walked into the park and went to the bathroom. The lady in the shop comes walking up to me and says, \"I need to confiscate that selfie stick.\" I asked why and she was rude with her explanation enough for another guest, a mom with her child, interrupted to help me. She even explained that it wasn\\'t a selfie stick but a tripod. After the mom helped me, the older lady employee let me go to take it to lost and found, where they said I was okay to take it into the park. They just reminded me to not use it like a selfie stick. I agreed and went into the park. It was too much of a hassle for me to even take it out of my purse again. Both the security and the lost and found were great with customer service! The older lady might have been having a bad day. I was in Disneyland the happiest place on earth and my favorite place on earth, so I let it go because I didn\\'t want this incident to damper my visit especially because it was my first time with my boyfriend. I LOVE LOVE Disneyland. We both had so much fun! I can\\'t wait to go to WDW with him now and maybe even the cruise to Europe.',\n",

We also missed having our breakfast at Plaza Inn with Disney characters as they shut down for breakfast strictly at 11am. We got there literally at 11:01am and were refused entry. So if you are visiting the park during the week you will have very little time to go have breakfast there. Park opens at 10am and breakfast is over at 11am.',\n",

The parade was Christmas themed and was quite long! Highly recommend visiting during the holidays!',\n",
       " 'So, we’ve returned from our trip to the USA and the West Coast, a trip that ended with a Five day visit to Disneyland in Anaheim.For the benefit of those of you who have only ever made the journey to Walt Disney World near Orlando, is a trip to Disneyland worth it, or can you get much of the same experiences in Central Florida?Firstly, Disneyland is made-up of only two theme parks, one of which, Disney California Adventure, had a troubled and frustrating gestation before finally getting itself on track only in recent years. Disney’s keystone in California is Disneyland itself, the original 1955 park that took elements from existing American theme parks and pleasure gardens, and perfectly fused them together into ‘the’ definitive family entertainment destination.Walt Disney World in Florida was an effort to break free of the historic limitations of the California site and, over the years, has expanded to a total of four parks across enormous acreage. The most recognisable park is Magic Kingdom and it is this park that is a homage to Disneyland. Elements are shared between the parks, but none are true replicas of one another, gentle facsimiles persist, but many seemingly familiar attractions have slight differences, and many attractions are unique to one location or the other.Disneyland and Magic Kingdom are therefore closely related, while California Adventure shares some of its heritage with the content of Disney’s other Florida offerings: Hollywood Studios, EPCoT and, Animal Kingdom.From a purely package holiday perspective WDW wins, with a much larger size, it’s much more capable of sustaining a family vacation for a much longer visit (the typical two-weeks that British visitors are likely to book). There are other benefits too; multiple Disney owned hotels, on-site restaurants aplenty, water parks, shopping & entertainment, and close by, Universal Florida and SeaWorld too. WDW is cleverly designed to act as the hub for all of your holiday needs and is increasingly, with dining packages, digital ticketing, multiple pre-bookable attractions, and experiences, a completely integrated Disney experience from sun-up to sun-down.Disneyland is a very different experience to its upstart younger sibling and this is where some very surprising elements reveal themselves.For starters Disneyland is small, though they may look similar, Magic Kingdom is quite a bit larger, and Cinderella’s Castle in Florida is massive when compared to Anaheim’s original Sleeping Beauty Castle. The limited scale of Disneyland was a necessity of the constraints of the original site and of Walt being unable to afford more land when embarking on the project. With finances tight, Disneyland was soon hemmed-in by hotels, restaurants, and vacant lots purchased by speculative real-estate developers. Over the years, Disneyland’s designers have become adept at squeezing attractions into an increasingly full plot, the result is a surprisingly intimate experience that WDW seeks to duplicate but, because of its more generous size and despite using clever tricks with scale and perspective, doesn’t quite manage to replicate. Disneyland still has Walt’s influence around every corner and, though planned and conceived by him, WDW didn’t even break ground until after Walt’s deathSecondly, Disneyland is much more of a local’s park; that’s not to say that hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors, or those from across much of the USA don’t venture to Anaheim, it’s just that the overwhelming majority of visitors are from the LA and Southern California conurbation and this lends the park a more casual vibe. Many Californian’s are day visitors or just there on short stays, and the popularity of annual passes mean that many can drop-in for an afternoon or evening visit almost any day of the week. Attendance levels can therefore fluctuate dramatically, at times outside of peak demand, particularly during mid-week, the parks can be remarkably quiet compared to Florida. Walt Disney World is becoming much more of a year-round destination to the point where crowds are flattening-out and periods that have historically benefitted from low attendances are starting to get squeezed.The next difference is in the time you may want to dedicate to visiting the parks. Disneyland Resort (that’s Disneyland and the neighbouring Disney California Adventure) can be attempted, at the right time of year, in just two days (one day for each park). In some favourable circumstances, a reasonable taster of both parks can even be managed in a single day! This opens-up Disney as a vacation excursion destination, something that can be added, but need not dominate, a busy schedule spent visiting Los Angeles, San Diego or other Californian cities and landmarks. General Admission theme park tickets start with single day options and top out at five day passes, remember to specify park-hopper tickets if you wish to skip between both parks in a single day. So, Disneyland works well as an addition to any trip that brings you to California, rather than necessarily being the focus of a long vacation. WDW is a destination that visitors commit multiple days to, with one and two week visits increasingly popular, and except for a few days at Universal Florida, many people never leave the boundaries of the Florida resort at all.Finally there are attractions in California that you won’t find in Florida and some special takes on some familiar WDW favourites that are exclusive to Anaheim. Here are some of your exclusives:Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye – a high speed truck ride through a South American treasure templeThe Matterhorn Bobsleds – the world’s first tubular steel rollercoaster that winds its way through the iconic Matterhorn Mountain that borders FantasylandFinding Nemo Submarine Voyage – the famous Disney submarines given a Pixar MakeoverGuardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout – the extremely clever and uniquely re-themed Hollywood Tower of TerrorCars Land – the phenomenal multi-million dollar recreation of Radiator Springs, featuring three unique attractions centred on the popular characters from the Cars films including the amazing Radiator Springs Racers.Paradise Pier and California Screamin’ – currently undergoing a reimagining as Pixar Pier and The Incredicoaster (themed on the Incredibles, just in time for the film’s sequel)Grizzly Peak – a water raft ride through a Californian National ParkMickey’s Toontown – a mash-up between the worlds of Disney Animation and Who Framed Roger RabbitThe World of Color – A spectacular water fountain show held on the lake in California Adventure and enhanced with pyrotechnics, lasers, and animated projectionsAdded to these, are some attractions that manage to beat their duplicates:Haunted Mansion – from Halloween thru Christmas, this attraction is exclusively redecorated to include special theming from: “A Nightmare Before Christmas”, turning-it into a unique attraction that makes Florida theme park fans extremely jealousPirates of the Caribbean – This is the superior US version of the classic, with better drops and better loading and unloading (just don’t look at the Shanghai Disneyland version)It’s a Small World – The Disneyland original features the iconic clock and the original world’s fair outdoor beginning absent from the WDW editionSo, should you visit Disneyland? Our opinion is yes, just with some conditions. If you are visiting California, definitely try and add it to your list; you’ll just have to determine how much time you’ll want to spend there. We recommend between two and three days in low season and midweek, if you’re visiting in high season, the two parks can get quite full and the only guarantee of seeing and riding everything may be to stretch a visit out to four or five days – depending of course, on just how ‘Disney’ you are.There’s no dining-plan at Disneyland and the park dining is limited when compared to WDW, but there are a few great restaurants inside the gates (reserve using the Disneyland App) and some reasonable offerings nearby.If you’re familiar with WDW, you won’t find magic-bands or advance fast passes in California, but there have been recent changes to introduce a little technological ticket management to Disneyland. For a $10 per guest daily supplement, guests can now link their park tickets to their Disney Account using the Disneyland App, benefits include an unlimited photo-pass, and fast pass reservations that won’t require a visit to the attraction to get a time.Tying Disney to a visit to Universal Studios in Hollywood is not as practical as the Florida Equivalent, as the parks are on opposite sides of LA and the traffic on the freeway between the two destinations can be torturous. Another great theme park experience, Six Flags Magic Mountain, in Valencia, is even further away, to the North of Los Angeles. Our advice, should you wish to add Universal and Six Flags to your itinerary, use a hotel near to Hollywood or Universal City and stay a few nights there using that as your base, before moving on to Anaheim.If you’re looking for another theme park experience closer to Disneyland, you can visit Knott’s Berry Farm, also in Anaheim and just a few minutes away. Disney doesn’t offer any water parks at Disneyland, but nearby Knott’s Berry Farm does have a reasonable offering in the shape of Soak City and Six Flags has the excellent Hurricane Harbor (both open seasonally).So, for us Disneyland is a gem. Yes, inevitably, there is a lot of duplication between California and Florida, but there’s still plenty of unique experiences too. Despite the clamour from some Disney fans that the company should replicate everything in both locations, Disney is clever enough to know that allowing each resort to have its share of exclusive attractions allows them to have a distinctive character. It’s this approach that makes a visit to either location such a different and worthwhile experience.Footnote: My wife and I took our first holiday together to California, Disneyland was my first experience of a Disney park (California Adventure was still the parking lot at the time), despite having been to WDW lots of times since, Disneyland remains my favourite Disney Park, after all, they say that you never forget your first time…',\n",

Sleeping beauty castle, Peter pan, finding nemo (I have no idea how they make the fish seem like they're really there its so freaky), pirates of the carribean (omg the animatronics on johnny Depp is amazing and the fight scenes and lighting wow), and the jungle cruise is so punny, but I actually think kids won't love it as much as I did but I loved it. Thrilling rides include Indiana Jones (most thrilling and arguably best ride. Matterhorn bobsled as well was great with some surprise around the corners. The shows are actually fantastic - Abe Lincoln, royal theatre (and I loved reliving my favourite Disney classics as they redid tangled and beauty and the beast but in a theatre like, Comedic way), laughing house, tiki room (omg didn't expect that to be so good),You can't beat meeting the Disney princesses for girls who grew up with Disney and they were as awesome as my imagination, they stayed in character even when I asked them weird questions haha.

       " 'Husband & I had very fond memories of previous visits to Disneyland which we had hoped to share with our 3 teenage chn however the excessive number of people let into the park meant HUGE queues for everything (I’m talking 2-3 hour waits for a single ride). Food & drink queues also long. Consequently the whole day became ride-centric and we obtained little ‘magic’ that such an experience should afford. Additionally the ‘fast pass’ app was down, however this had only succeeded in getting us one ride more quickly the previous day at Disney California anyway. All disappointed.',\n",

Unless you enjoy looking at a faded coral and wall covered with bubbles for over 15 minutes with a couple a Nemo animations here and there.

Cast members all friendly, most even wished our youngest happy birthday. The disney app with max pass was easy to use and with it the only line we waited in was for Peter pan with no fast pass. Fantasmic was a treat but hard for the kids to see because of adults stepping in front of them. All and all a good trip.

       " 'First thing you need to do is download the disneyland app and get MaxPass. It\\'s the new digital form of fastpass and will enable you to get fast passes without having to actually go to the ride to get them--saves time. Worth every penny--it\\'s $10/per pass. The second you get into the park and your tickets are scanned you can start using it. You will use your phone as your Maxpass to scan when you enter the ride. Also FYI--this will drain your cell battery, so have a backup battery or carry a portable charger. Definitely utilize the MaxPass so you aren\\'t wasting time just walking around the park.  40\" in height is the magic number for most of Disney\\'s roller coasters. Big Thunder, Star Tours, & Space Mountain. Matterhorn is 42\". If your child is not over the height limit, you can utilize the rider switch pass. Just tell a cast member that you need one and then One parent can go on ride with a child and then switch with your friend or spouse once they return without waiting in line. There are multiple parades over the day and seating fills up quickly. It goes from Small World to down Main street and most people try to sit down Main street, the right side of the castle in between Matterhorn and Alice in Wonderland--better viewing and doesn\\'t fill up as quickly. At the entrance there are park maps and the daily schedule of parades as it changes everyday, so be sure to grab one. Plus it will also be on the app. The parades are exactly the same so my suggestion is to pick one to watch and then utilize the shorter lines in fantasyland during the other one. Upon your arrival--stop by City Hall (right inside the entrance on the left hand side) and get a birthday button and the rest of you can get \"I\\'m celebrating\" buttons. Also, my personal opinion...the best place to see the fireworks is by the entrance in front of the train station. They do projections on the store fronts down main street that you can\\'t see unless you are further back and you get the full view of the effect that way..( I received all of this feedback from my friend Michele and agree with her :) We love the park.

My daughter loved the princess and my son loved the thunder mountain railway, haunted mansion, tower of terror.Fast passes made our lives easy but fo use them wisely. Loved the ambience, the crowd and activities all around the parks. Easy to move around with strollers and so many restaurants and food stalls to keep your tummy satisfied. Note of advice, take some snacks and water bottles with you when traveling with young children, as you will be spending the whole day. Make sure to stay till the end if you want to see the shows and fireworks.',\n",
       " \"Disneyland never gets old, We have brought our 2 older boys there and now that we have a girl, I get to experience with her all the princess themed area like fantasy land. We went during summer time which was super crowded. We were used to going around October when weather is slightly cooler and lines shorter than the usual summer break in June. Cons: expensive whether it's a single park multiple days ticket or a multiple days hopper tickets. To top it off, staying at the Grand California hotel was not cheap too (however, I liked that we had easy access to the park), lines are always long, waited 50 minutes for peter pan-ridiculous), food and drinks expensive, everything pricey!! Pros: FUN FUN FUN, it never gets old.\",\n",
       " 'We purchased a 5 day park hopper for our family of 5 and we had the best time at Disney during our vacation!! Our youngest son (6) broke his foot a week prior to vacation and Disney was very accommodating. For two days we rented a wheelchair on site but found the travel from our hotel to the wheelchair rental a long way for our little guy to use his crutches. We ended up renting a wheelchair from our hotel and Disney had no problem with us bringing it into the park. They no longer require you to get a pass for mobility issues as the wheelchair is evident enough. This allowed us to get return times, enter through special entrances and sometimes skip a bit of the line. They try to be as fair as possible with the people who are waiting normally but in some cases we flew through the lines much faster. The park is incredibly clean. There is never a piece of popcorn on the ground for long as people are continuously cleaning. The food and drinks in the park are insanely expensive, but of course we ate them. There is a snack cart or a beverage stand or a restaurant around every turn. It was nice we never really had to search for food or washrooms as they are all over the place. Unfortunately the water rides were closed as this is their downtime so we never got those but everything else was great. Download the app and take advantage of the info on there! Also, everyone there is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The popcorn cart employee knew exactly where the next churro stand was so my boy could get the treat he was eyeing. Everyone will stop to help and answer questions. It truly is the most magical place to be and we recommend the five day hopper so you can take in all that Disney has to offer!!',\n",
       " 'After doing Orlando a couple of years ago I admit I was a little apprehensive about this one. I couldn’t see how it was going to measure up. My initial fears were met as I walked in and saw the castle, it’s TINY! I was thinking ‘omg this is going to be terrible’. I’d say after about another ten minutes all concerns had left and I had the best day ever! Try not to think and compare it to Orlando. I loved its charm of being the first Disney park and it being a little smaller (still didn’t fit it all into a day) and the Fantasmic show at the end gave me goosebumps. The magic of Disney is very much alive here, all the workers were 5 star and really add to your experience as you would expect, the park is stunning and whilst there isn’t an option to buy an upgrade for a queue jump ticket the facility they have for free is really efficient! My tips would be make sure you stay til the end to see the show! Use your fast passes wisely, if there is a ride with a fast pas and you have a three hour wait, check another ride with a shorter time, go on that fast pass and then get the last longer fast pass. As I left the park walking through the little castle I actually changed my mind and loved that they’ve kept it smaller and how it originally was, it shows how far the theme parks have developed, it would be boring if all of the parks were the same.',\n",
       " 'One of the best trips we have ever taken to Disney. It brought the Holiday Season full circle with the mystical light display of Sleeping Beauty Castle to the fake snow flying through the air on Main Street. It was the best park experience ever and loved the holiday spirit! We will be back again and again in 2018.',\n",
       " 'I’m a Florida resident and visit Disney World often with my family. My wife wanted to go here to compare. We both enjoyed our day, despite quite a bit of construction within the park, but DL just doesn’t compare favorably to DW. What’s up with that tiny castle?',\n",
       " \"Yes I know it's Disneyland and they are going to be busy but for a Thursday, it was crazy! But my 3 kids had fun and didn't mind the crowds.\",\n",
       " \"First off- I am a huge Disney fan and for me it has such roots in the Anaheim area and with Walt Disney's original vision that it is a must see.I visited on a Monday toward the end of January and it was extremely busy- I think it's similar to Tokyo Disney in that it has a very densely populated area with lots of AP holder's who are willing to take the day off (or take advantage of goverment shutdown!) and spend time at DIsney. The park did handle the numbers well however it does make the whole experience more stressful, especially when you don't expect it.The park itself is a blend of the classic Disney rides from Alice in Wonderland through to Buzz Lightyears's Astro Blasters set into well laid out zones which are all very distinctive. There are a good range of restaurants both sit down and counter service however I would definitely make a reservation if you're looking at one of the waiter service restaurants. I was disappointed in the gift shops as there wasn't really anything special that was different- I thought especially with it being the original Disney park, they would make more of that rather than standard gift shop fare you can find in Paris or Hong Kong.I think ultimately for me, Disney will always give you a day out that's different and special however I think this park has lost its way a little bit and for that reason I would probably head to Knott's Berry Farm instead for my next visit.\",\n",
       " 'Missed the old style or type of service Disneyland used to give . Yes I can help you get to next ride or store no problem.Employees in store we went in were outstanding in there help nice touch.To many of the employees on rides were just talking to each seems over staff on to many ,other like they didn’t have tIme to help us to get to next area as some things have changed since we were there last . Our kids even picked up on this and told us about how they felt about it. Like they didn’t have time for you they just wanted to talk to each other rude staff members.So help or lack of it made that what was new and or where we could get our handicap person on this ride or not uncomfortable to say the least.To many employees together seemed to just stand around togetherness and talked,we did find a few employees at it’s a small world to help and goofy kitchen staff was a great help to us.We missed the nights fireworks as we didn’t know about the time it was taking place and we were coming back from dinner at goofys kitchen wonderful staff clean comfortable as I said and saw the very end,we would have gone back sooner if we had got the right answer to what time fireworks display was going to happen. We talked as family oh well we saw little of the end from the tram ride back so better then not at all.we tried to make the best of all and have wonderful vacation on earth.Ice cream pineapple treats was great while waiting to get In to see singing birds a must to try and we all loved it worth it oh yes indeed. Enjoy the jungle ride ,submarine,cars ,toon town, pirates of the Caribbean , riverboat ride,shops, once you got into parking garage it was spacious clean comfortable to get into next area to get bags check out and then on a ride over to park all came together. Long lines to get in to park but that’s nothing new .We all talked on way home and we will go back but we are going to have to have better service and help on our visit.Maybe it’s not this bad all the time.We went away with will give it another try before we say no way Universal and warner brothers is so much more fun.Kids and adults love the fun had at other two places in the past.',\n",

       " 'We spent 3 days at Disneyland California. Day 1 was a learning curve. We got a locker for our cooler with lunch and snacks just inside the entrance between the two parks. This worked well for bathroom and lunch breaks when we bounced back and forth. Day 2 we took full advantage of Fast Passes and day 3 we topped up with a few rides we’d missed and some we wanted to retake. The light show was amazing.',\n",

Anyway, I missed to see in the parade my fav disney princess because i dozed off due to jet lag! The parade is a must see for me everytime I visit the park. I always feel good and happy.',\n",

Why was I not told about that at the gate? A woman was sick over my rucksack on a Star Wars simulator ride, I told staff and they let the next lot of riders on without cleaning it which just amazed me. I had followed this woman out and asked her husband to wipe my bag clean as it was just disgusting, he refused and said it’s not his or her fault. I said well it’s not mine! Had no regard to my belonging being soiled in her fish smelling vomit. I had done my best to wipe it clean but it still smelled, I walked to guest services explaining my problem and they had no suggestion, I asked for a complimentary locker so I didn’t have to carry it around with me and gross myself and others out anymore and they said I would have to pay! This was my first visit and was totally spoiled. Fireworks were disappointing and the pizza was grossly overpriced, as was a Coca Cola.',\n",

       " 'Our iPhone app showed we walked almost 8 miles on the day we were in Disneyland. Phew! Didn’t feel so all day. That says it all. We were there on the 26th of December 2017. You can imagine the crowd situation. Had to wade through the crowds almost all day from the time we entered till the late night we left from there. A few things we tried and learnt. 1. There are several restaurants in 2mile distance. We took a Lyft taxi (just for $4). Had a proper dinner and went back to Disney. That was a good 1 hr break and amazing food compared to the fast food and expensive ones at Disney. More so the waiting time. Only draw back is the walking to the main entrance. But it is worth the effort. 2. Pack some good snacks especially if you’re there with kids. They did allow our food items although we had read a few reviews saying outside food would not be allowed. We did have a few sandwiches, cookies and a little rice. This was handy to have some quick bites in between rides when we anyway knew we would be waiting in the queue. 3. Make sure you carry a battery power bank for the phone. We need to keep checking the Disney app for fast pass times for many rides often. Make sure you have the Disney app installed on multiple phones and use the same login so your fast passes are available on multiple phones. This would be handy as a back up plan when one phone is dead. 4. We didn’t have much time to plan in advance. But a little bit of research and watching videos in advance would have helped in zeroing in on the top rides. We didn’t have time for Indiana Jones. The wait time was almost 1.5 to 2 hours for most of the time. Had we known in advance we would have probably gone there in the morning. Splash mountain is top of the rank for my family. My older daughter and I did this three times. It’s such a fun. You will be very wet if you are on the front seat. Better carry some ponchos. Our ponchos were very helpful in keeping the backpacks and purses from getting wet. We didn’t care so much about ourselves getting wet so much. 5. There is a special light show in the night. For this one we need to get physical tickets even if you have the fast pass. I didn’t know that before. These tickets help you have front seats with better view. We ended up standing at the far end and watching it but it was very difficult. My wife and I had to hold up our kids so they have a better view. The lighting show on the castle is way too good. Please don’t miss this. This is open to all. Make sure you are aware of the show timings on that day and plan to be there well in advance. 6. Lastly. Arrive early. Take breaks. Stay till late evening. If you are concerned kids will be tired and you may not be able to stay longer, don’t be. We are a good example. We were there early and retuned to the hotel at midnight. Take it easy. Enjoy. I am sure we will go back to Disney in a few years.',\n",
       " 'We took our six year old son to Disneyland Dec 21,22,23 2017. I was afraid of the crowds and congestion. Neither one really were an issue!

The highlight was of course Fantasmic and World of Color.',\n",

Go to the main ride attractions such as Indiana jones it's only a 10min wait which is nothing compare to how it gets in the day (2-3hours). I always take a bag pack and fill it up with snacks and drinks especially on a sunny day it helps a lot and it's less expensive. Tickets are over $100 and when you have a family of 5 you try to be mindful of how to save . I love Disneyland & I go every year.!\",\n",

Parking took over an hour, mot organized, getting in the gate took over an hour not very well organized. It was a miserable experience.',\n",

We were in line quite a few times when we were told the ride had stopped and they weren't sure when it would be back up. This added longer lines to other rides and made for long waits.

You can ask for free buttons to wear for 1st time visit, birthday, anniversary, etc. We were disappointed that during the week there were no parades or fireworks.Food is awesome! Disney does provide free cups of water at every restaurant or snack shop. Really helps save money on drinks. Rent a locker to store jackets or your own snacks. It's worth the money.

Unfortunately we started off in line. We parked in the mickey and friends parking garage and our friends parked in a parking lot. They were at the gate am hour before us even though we parked at the same time. There was a long line to get into the garage, long line for security and a long line to get on the tram to get to the park. Luckily the sp5p lets us know when fast passes are available and told us wait times so we could choose which rides were worth waiting for. We also used the single rider lines which saved us a ton of time. The rides were a blast and the kids had a great time. They all liked Disneyland over Legoland. Space mountain is still my favorite ride, and now it's the kids favorite too. Maybe not worth an hour plus wait so be sure to get a fast pass early in the day as they do sell out, or go single rider. Food is quite pricey so we brought ours with us. We also brought our own water bottles. There are drinking fountains to refill them. If you get the app before you go, youcan see all the restaurant menus and prices to see if it fits your budget. There were 10 of us, so that added up!\",\n",

For a Wednesday it was pretty crowded though teh Fast Pass did help alleviate alot of standing in line. HIGHLY RECOMMEND the fast pass as the only way to enjoy the park (cough up the $$$). There were many rides that were down and many arts of the park were walled off for construction in both parks Really there were too many things closed to warrant the high ticket price, but you have no choice. We did most of Disneyland park te first day. GET THERE EARLY TO BE ON THE GOOD RIDES - the afternoon its almost impossible even with a fast pass. We paid the big bucks for the Desert Party at the World of Color in the other park. It was worth it and would recommend. The Carnation Cafe has really gone downhill so I'd hits the restaurants near Pirates for better service and food.Al in all is SOOO much different and less magical than when my wife and I were kids.

It was also extremely hot, so there were some issues with some of the rides and the monorail wasn't working, but honestly NONE of that mattered. Disneyland is magical no matter what. My husband hats crowds and waiting, so we invested in the MaxPass every day. The pictures alone were worth it! We haven't had a photo together that isn't a selfie in so long and we got over 100 on this trip. It was awesome! The shorter wait for rides also allowed us to do so much more, which we both appreciated.

Food and beverage venues are varied and plentiful and generally pretty easy to get a seat.Fireworks were cancelled the night we were there due to weather but the lights etc are still very good.

Our first day at Disneyland I spent 2 hours trying to park at Disneyland. Then when my family goes to get into the park Disneyland closed the gate next to us as we are next to go in and tell the 15 or so people next to us to get in line in front of us even though we were next. We visited California Adventures we were able to go on all the rides that were open the first day. I bought a 2 day pass this time 1 Park per day which we wasted half of our 1st day trying to park. It seems like half the rides are closed at Disneyland land and California Adventures while I New most of the rides were closed when we went it made the parks really crowded. We stood in line to see Captain America and again we were next in line to see him and they allowed some other guests not in line to walk up and see him before us. I’m guessing they had some kind of VIP status. I guess if you are rich you are treated better at Disneyland now. We went to Disneyland the next day the crowds were out of Control, the lines seemed ridiculous for being January midweek. Just wondering what we are paying for these days??? The park still seemed pretty clean. I was super disappointed that you now have to have a fast pass to see the Fantasmic show. It used to be my favorite but we missed it this trip because I didn’t know they now had a fast pass for that too. Like a lot of others I also agree that Disneyland is falling apart and no longer tries to make everyone have a great experience.',\n",
       " 'The best time to visit Disneyland is when it rains. The crowds are at a minimum. Instead of waiting in 2 hour lines they are 15 to 20 minutes. Just wear appropriate rain gear & enjoy! Make sure you also wear comfortable shoes. We walked 8 1/2 miles one day. Once the rain stopped some of the rides that were closed opened & we were able to walk right on. We rode everything & many twice. My favorites are Big Thunder Mountain, The Tiki Room, The Jungle Cruise, Star Tours & The Train Ride around the park. The Park is unbelievably clean given the amount of people who visit. It also has enough bathrooms scattered throughout the Park. If you plan to eat there make sure you have a churro, corn dog & a dole whip. Yummy goodness! Also be prepared for expensive food & drinks.',\n",
       " \"Disneyland is great! Apart from it being rediculously expensive, the staff do a pretty great job of making sure your visit is a happy one. They clean the park constantly, it's amazing how they keep up. The food is decent although very pricey. They make sure the kids get fruit/veggies and other drinks besides soda with their meals which I really appreciated. The rides are outstanding and although you have to wait so long for some, there is always something to look at in the lines. The front gate entrance was an issue almost every morning. I feel they would move a lot faster if they separated those who had already had their pictures taken from those who were visiting for the first time. Taking pictures for a family of 5 or more requires a lot of time. They could have staff walking through the line weeding out those who need pictures and putting it in the system while we wait, as opposed to just letting it all happen at the entrance which is so time consuming and holds up the line--Especially for those who have their pictures linked to the their tickets and are eagerly waiting to start their day. Always room for improvement in some areas such as this. Hopefully they can find a way to fix this.\",\n",
       " \"Yesterday Fri Jan 19 was the first time my partner and I had ever visited Disneyland. A few notes:- We parked at the Mickey and Friends building, $20 flat rate for the day, and a 10 min walk or 5 min tram ride to the park. Not bad.- Started with Adventureland and made our way round clockwise, finishing with Tomorrowland. This meant we walked straight onto Indiana Jones, and had only 5-10 min waits for Pirates of the Carribean and Haunted Mansion. Our longest wait of the day was 1.5 hours for Space Mountain which wasn't worth it IMO, but you have to go to know. - There are virtually no characters roaming around anymore, as apparently they get mobbed and disrupt the flow of guests. You will need to go to special themed areas like Mickey's house to see them. This took a bit of the Disney out of it for us, and made the place feel like just another theme park.- The whole park was immaculate! I counted one lolly wrapper and 2 empty drink bottles the entire time we were there. - We showed up with no plan at all for where to go or what rides to go on, used no Fastpasses at all, and still managed to cover the whole park in 10 hours. However it was a weekday in winter, Splash Mountain was closed, and we skipped the Matterhorn and just strolled through Storybookland apart from King Arthur's Carousel and the boat cruise. Still, the Fastpasses are a great idea. They cost nothing and will cut your wait times in half or more.Overall it was a great visit, just slightly let down by the lack of characters and/or Disney feel if that makes sense.\",\n",
       " 'I was lucky enough to visit Disneyland from Australia as a child, as was my husband. This trip was to continue the family tradition and it did not disappoint! We brought our 2 daughters aged 8 and 10. There really is no more magical place in the world. I planned carefully before my trip to maximise our time in the park. Had such an amazing time that we are adding another visit to our Canada trip at the end of 2018...just have to see the holiday decorations :-)Words cannot describe the magic!!',\n",
       " 'We used to be season pass holders and we are not from California. I see it progressively declining with each visit, bit this last one was the worst. Not only are the prices for everything from parking ($20) to horrible food ridiculous, bit the cast members have lost their magic. We had multiple rude cast members this time. We were going to upgrade our tickets to add more days bit after this experience, no thanks.',\n",
       " 'Oh my gods. I had been waiting 25 years to go here. It did NOT disappoint. Rides were amazing! Even lining up for them was part of the experience. Smart Pass makes getting onto the really popular rides such a breeze.The park itself is SO well maintained. Clean, well-cared for, and easy to get around. The cast members who help load riders on and off rides were so efficient, there was no fuss. Things are so well-run, and they have just thought of all the little things. There are roving photographers all over the place, who will take your photo in front of particular attractions, or with characters. You can then buy those photos, or hand over your own camera or phone and the photographers will take a few extra shots on those. Also other little niceties like the baby swap and ride area at the rides, so if you have two people visiting with a baby, there is a waiting area for one person to wait with the bub while their partner rides, then you switch for the next run of the ride. Not that I was using that facility, but I just thought it was so thoughtful that they made that available! The food stalls and restaurants were also amazing. I could have eaten at all of them! They have so many different options - pretzels and beignets being my favourite of the snacks! Overall, worth it. Grown ups and kids of all ages were enjoying themselves, and the whole place lived up to all my expectations!',\n",
       " 'Not too busy at the moment in Disney great weather and quick wait times with the fast pass.What can I say but it truly is a land of its own. A definite fast pass is the Indiana Jones ride in Adventure land and the Thunder railway in Frontierland. We did the bobsleds in the venting and the lights were fantastic.Lots of stuff to buy. Food is better than I remember 5 years ago as more choices than just deep fried available.Good walking shoes and determination to complete most things are a must! We have a 2 day park hopper and will be back again tomorrow. It’s great going between the two parks with California adventure and also downtown Disney. Yep still great even after all these years.',\n",
       " 'I have visited Disney for 20 years. great times . great memories. Over the last 5 years the park has become more crowded or less staffed. The rides are not kept up like they used to be or they are used harder . Disney used to be pristine. from rides to hedges to sparking restrooms. This is not the case any longer. It seems that good enough is the new standard. Having major attractions closed for renovations is part of the maintenance. Having 3 of your 6 major rides down seems like i am being ripped off. The food is 3 out of 10. the price is 400% out side in the real world. if you are going to charge me. that rate have the decency to make it taste like someone actually tried it before you tried to sell it. Bottom line is - you will go because you are forced by tradition - you will miss the good old days when there was pride taken in doing an exceptional job and a desire to provide you a magical day. my advice pack a lunch and a few snacks. Follow up a year later. Same issues only worse. Bathroom cleaning was just horrible. Gross as can be. The grounds were dirty and unkept. Buzz light year ride smelled so bad i was embarrassed I had my kids there. Food is still un worthy of any cost . Got stuck on space mountain snd thunder mountain. Go to universal Studios- they seem to be on the rise',\n",

       " \"Spent 3 days at Disneyland this year. Jan 14 to 17 th. They offered 20% off ticket price as it was low season and some major attractions were down.(Splash mountain, Haunted mansion, California screamin, Grizzly run, Mickey Ferris wheel). This was fine to me as we knew this before we bought our tickets. Once at the park the lines were 60 to 90 minutes wait as well as space mountain breaking down. Soaring over the world breaking down as well as Radiators springs Racers breaking down.What did I pay for exactly??? Indiana Jones and Pirates of Caribbean? Well Indiana Jones ride the Boulder didn't work and the time before that we sat in the dark for about 2 minutes before ride started moving again. Disneyland has been my favorite place to go for very many years but no more. Walt Disney would roll over in his grave if he could see what has become of this park.On a positive note knotts Berry farm for one day was cheaper and you get your fair share of rides I without the ridiculous wait time.\",\n",
       " 'Disneyland was much better experience than California Adventure was with our little boy (2.5 year old - less than three year old so he gets in free). But still due to the big crowds and queues on a weekday mid January it is not worth it. Also for us it is a mystery that many of the rides are closed off season. Disappointing. But people love Disney and you will I guess always get overcrowded and thereby the ticket price. For the small ones I must recommend LEGOLAND. It was the best experience with no crowds and a lot of rides suitable for those below 3. And has a lot of playgrounds that disney don’t have in their concept. Bad organization from Disney side as you need, even with the fast pass system, to spend most of the time waiting even on a weekday in mid January. But if you want to make your little one a little bit happy with some Disney flair then choose Disneyland over California Adventure and consider going to LEGOLAND.',\n",
       " \"Me and my husband have been at Dinsey World for Holidays and were prepared for the crowd, but believe me that in Disneyland there are much less people! The attractions lines at Disney World are 200-300 minutes! Disneyland gets pretty crowded, but it doesn't compare to Magic Kingdom.My advice if you want to go in New Year eve are:1.Fireworks: At Disneyland there are two schedules, one at 9 pm and at 11:50 pm. I recommend you see the 9 pm and look for a place to see them 2 hours before and then go to see the countdown in California Adventure, overthere you can have a beer, is less crowded and there is more space to walk. This way you can see the two New Year's special shows without so much stress.2. To make Fantasyland in 15 minutes: Disneyland closes at 2 am, so you can enter at 1:00 pm and do all Fantasyland because there are not many children.3. Buy the Max Pass! You won't regret it! This allows you to acquire fast pass without having to go to the attraction. In New Year if you find! You can also have all your photos of photo pass and have beautiful memories.4. Don't be afraid to change the park as often as you want! Take advantage of being in front of each other and help you not feel stressed and trapped.Good luck!\",\n",
       " 'Well I think Disneyland never disappoints this was my third time and so just love the place and would highly recommend going at Christmas time as the decorations are spectacular as are the fireworks nightly. Lots of variety for food and drinks and for first timers would recommend at least 3 to 5 days if you want to see both parks and everything. Get the Disney App as it is wait times on rides and is very helpful and just enjoy the best place on earth!',\n",

Friday was so crowded we had trouble getting around. But this is to be expected, it’s the happiest place on earth right? The staff was wonderful and the park was clean. I honestly have no complaints. Just make sure to research before you go!! A lot of bad reviews are for ride closers and park closing early. May has grad nights where park closes early. Look at the Disney refurbishment schedules. This way you know what to expect.',\n",
       " \"Love Disneyland. Don't love the crowds or the ever raising prices. You have to go through security before you enter the park which is fine. I wish they had an express lane for people who aren't bringing the house with them into the park. Between strollers, purses and backpacks it takes 30 minutes just to get to the line to show your ticket and get into the park. Once inside it was very crowded, but we bought a $10.00 each fast pass. This allows you to get fast passes from your phone without having to physically going to each ride and waiting in line to put your ticket in to get a fast pass. Worth the extra cost. In reality you should be able to do this for free, but Disney is in it for the money, so we have to suck it up and pay for the privilege. Despite the crowds we really enjoyed our day. Finally tried the turkey legs that are so famous. It was pretty good, but so salty that it tasted more like smoked hamhocks then turkey. Couldn't finish it. The next time I go to Disneyland will be during off season so I can enjoy my day without getting ran over by strollers and motorized scooters.\",\n",

We figured the day after MLK would be ok,...um, no. 3 long lines before we even get into the park! Main Street and the front of the castle have ugly plywood, Mansion and Splah Mntn closed...no reduction in price, but increase in crowds. Perhaps a cap on local passes? The smaller size of Disneyland (compared to World) can\\'t handle the crowds at all. its obvious that the Disney \"corporates\" haven\\'t experienced \"The Happiest Place\" like the rest of us.',\n",

They should limit the amount of people or double the price of admission and try and limit crowds on special days. So people can enjoy a special day at a special place. Nothing feels special when you can't take a step anywhere without almost stepping on someone.On the day I went, things were so congested and miserable that some people were walking around with very poor attitudes. I witnessed 2 different insidents where fights almost erupted. Not a nice atmosphere for the kids.I'll be hard pressed to return.\",\n",

       " 'Can you really say anything bad about Disneyland? It’s the happiest place on earth! I know that people complain that rides are closed – but come on, they have to fix up and maintain the rides for safety and enjoyment. If you do your research you will know which rides will be closed for refurbishment before you go. Also if you go before or after Christmas/Halloween there are going to be rides closed to prep for the holidays – just keep that in mind when you plan. The park does a great job looking the part for the holidays. We had the 3 day hopper pass and were able to go back and forth between both parks. I highly recommend getting the MaxPass. It’s totally worth the price in my opinion. We got to ride so many rides and never waited in line longer than 30 minutes plus you get all your pictures. Is it a pricy place to visit? Yes. Is it worth it? Giant yes! I was really impressed with 95% of the cast members – there is always going to be 1 or 2 grumpy pants but overall they are super friendly and helpful and there is always someone around to answer your questions. The characters were awesome. I was blown away with how well they interacted with my daughter. They never come out of character and they drew out my shy little girl and got her to laugh and smile. She was in awe meeting the princesses and when I look at all the pictures the girls seem so genuine and real. I know it’s a job and they are actors but they do a darn good job of convincing me that they are the real deal! They spend a good amount of time with each kid too.',\n",
       " 'We visited the parks with our two grandchildren ages 5 & 2 on a day the rest of our family including their parents visited Universal Studios but were in great hands with Tommy. Tommy helped us celebrate our grandson’s special birthday going beyond all expectations including - a gift of personalized birthday ears, arranging for us to be the first family through the gates at ToonTown for birthday greetings by Mickey Mouse and a special interaction with an animated Crush from Finding Nemo, who sang him Happy Hatch Day -just a few highlights out of a wonderful day spent in the parks. Our normally timid grandson made fast friends with Tommy whose advice he trusted to take the plunge and ride Space Mountain and the Matterhorn! Tommy was equally in tune with our two year old ensuring she enjoyed attractions like Disney’s Jr. Dance Party and the Enchanted Tiki Room show, highlights for us all. In both cases almost no waiting. I don’t have a tally of the number of rides and attractions we covered but it was a lot. We couldn’t believe how we wizzed by and straight onto things while other families stood in long lines waiting up to 90 minutes for many many of the attractions we enjoyed. Tommy worked diligently on our behalf, helped by pushing one of our two strollers or holding our grandson’s hand, made our lunch reservation choosing a great spot (but refusing our invitation to join us), even guiding us on the best ice cream for each of the two children. Great value for the price and we should know having used the official Disney tour guide just two days previously with our larger group of 8. That was great but short of getting onto kiddie rides like Dumbo that don’t offer the fast pass option or arranging special seating and no wait tome for Fantasmic, World of Colour, the Frozen Show this tour is a fabulous option for a fraction (1/4) of the price! We can’t recommend using this tour company highly enough. Thank you Tim Hammer (who also arranged (wonderful driver and beautiful van and car seats) our airport transfers and travel to Lego Land and to Tommy for helping to make this Disney family adventure run so smoothly.',\n",
       " \"Disney doesn't get to not make improvements and have things closed down. There are so many other theme parks that do it better these days. Why do they get to charge what they do and not have to upgrade or enhance the individual rides. These are the same exact rides so themed differently. It's a cart ride through a storybook or a boat ride through a storybook. Why is this acceptable for what they charge? Long lines in the rides that are open and then other major rides like Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain are closed?? Sorry Disney, I will take Universal over this moving forward\",\n",
       " \"Buy tickets online in advance so you can walk up to the turnstile and avoid the lines to buy tickets at the park. Arriving to the park 30 minutes before it opens will enable you to walk into the park as soon as it opens and avoid long lines for the first couple of hours you are there. Get a fast pass right after entering the park for one of the busiest rides and then spend your time getting on other rides until your fast pass time comes up. The park gets busier and busier as the day goes on. Things slow down at night when everyone waits along the water/river area during the 9 pm Fantasia show. That is also a great time to go on rides. The Fantastia show is pretty good to watch. You can get a Fast pass for a better view in the roped off area. Disneyland is strict about not letting you stand to watch the show in areas that are not designated viewing areas. Use the train to get around the park The train stops by the Main Entrance, New Orleans, Toon Town, and Tomorrowland approximately every 5-8 minutes. You can catch the train from the main entrance to another part of the park without walking. It's especially useful after you are exhausted from walking around the park all day for getting back to the Main Entrance when your ready to leave. You can hop on the train right after the Fantastia water/light/firework show in New Orleans and get a ride to the Main Entrance/Exit. Schedule a reservation if you want to eat at the Blue Bayou. You can bring food and drinks into the park, just not in glass containers. Try to go during the off season, do research online before going to learn other tips for maximizing your time at the park.\",\n",

They have moved Dumbo several times But Adventure Land is very much unchanged. Yes, they evicted the Swiss Family Robinson out of the tree house they carefully built and let some Tarzan guy move in. But that is the Disney spirit of change. Now Princess Leia and the Star Wars gang are moving into what had been the painted desert. Alway fun.We now enjoy just sitting in a restaurant patio and watching the crowds. Starbucks is is fairly recent addition. Change, nostalgia, and attempts to improve on the past.

       " 'We went to Disneyland last Friday Jan 12. No Splash Mountain, no Hunted Mansion and the gardens in the entrance and in front of the castle were covered with hideous jail-like plywood walls, so no fireworks or parades either. And, just to complete our worst experience ever, when it was our turn to ride the Space Mountain, they closed it at 9:45 (park closed at 12:00) \"due to technical problems\". We later heard a lot of people complaining that all other main attractions also \"suspiciously\" closed at the same time (they probably wanted everyone to leave already?). If the Company really needs to fix some attractions, then they should wait to fix their main gardens, so at least people can have a parade and fireworks. Our general impression in this whole matter was that the Company did not want to spend on parades, fireworks or even the electricity of the attractions, since most visitors were annual pass holders (which we were not).Another couple of comments: (1) Even though we are not pass holders, we have gone at least once a year for the past 12 years, and we have always found the same characters for encounters with the public. There are no longer surprises like in the 80\\'s or 90\\'s, where you could walk into Pinnochio, Captain Hook or a whole different character every time. (2) The employees seem distant (just like in any second-tier park) and are no longer friendly.All in all, the Magic is gone. Regretfully, Disneyland has become another dull \"amusement\" park. From \"the best\" to \"another one\".',\n",
       " \"We had hoped we had picked a less busy time to visit the park, after Jan. 10. Surprise - by midday it was packed, by late afternoon didn't even feel safe to be there and keep track of 4 kids. Without the Fastpass Program, we would have spent thousands of dollars to be there and would have accomplished very little. Getting there early, which we did, is a must as you can hopefully get in one lineup for a desired ride without using your Fastpass. Visually the sites are amazing, but on Day 2, you want to maximize your ride potential, which is almost impossible given the throngs of people and the long lineups. The parts of the Park we enjoyed the most were the parts that were most empty in the morning. We'd also bought a 3 Day Park Hopper Pass, but discovered the only way to get from one to the other was to go through the main gates again, so suffering lineup fatigue we didn't do that. We did have high hopes for the one Early Morning Magic Pass Day, but discovered that most of the rides the kids wanted to go on were not operational that early and they were grumpy from being woken up early. Also no fireworks, not sure if that's standard for January or because of the California fires, but it was disappointing. Yes we did have fun, and the kids were amazed, but as a destination when you invest a lot of time and a lot of money it was disappointing.\",\n",

We were happy to experience Disneyland with a group of 12 people. Our group had young children 5-10 yr. olds as well as teenagers and we enjoyed all the rides together. The only rides that we couldn’t ride with our 5 yr. old were Indiana Jones and Space Mountain because she is 44 “ inches tall and kids need to be at least 46” to ride it. All the other rides required a minimum of 42” inches. Star Wars is much improved since last I remember, included stuff from Rogue One, etc. We purchased tickets at Target.com with a 5% discount, but also found out that if you live in Southern California, sometimes there is special offers .

There was no music playing when walking between rides. Many of the rides were broken on one of the mornings we were there, but by mid afternoon they were all working again.Make sure you take advantage of all the fast passes available as they allow you to skip the line when it is your time. Also if the ride allows single rider option take that as well. There were multiple rides where the line was 1+ hours and we only had to wait 10 minutes in single rider line.',\n",

       " 'One tip - you\\'ll see lots of advice saying to run straight to Peter Pan to avoid the lines that form later in the day, but now EVERYONE does this. lol So unless you are right in the front of the queue to enter the park, this trick is not going to save you any time at all. This was our first time using the lockers and wow was that helpful. We brought some long sleeve shirts/jackets to wear at night and paying $7 to not have to carry them around all day was the best $7 I spent at the park. There is a Star Wars movie next to Hyperspace Mountain, that was good only because it gave us a chance to sit down. Surprisingly disappointing - I get that Honey I Shrunk The Kids is an old reference now, but at least it was a quality show. My only other complaint is that there were a surprising number of breakdowns of the rides. It took us three times to ride Indiana Jones as we\\'d wait in line and then they shut it down. (The first time we were literally the next people to board the car.) We had to beg the kids to give it the third try, they just said \\'That ride is broken, it never works.\" (They LOVED it once we actually got to ride it of course.) Space Mountain, the Haunted Mansion and a couple of rides at California Adventure also broke down while we were waiting, though not all of them for long. I\\'ve never seen that many in one trip before, it was very strange and I hope just a bad day and not signs that Disney is slipping. Complaints aside, obviously I\\'m a big fan of the magic (all of the staff we talked to were wonderful) and we had a great trip overall. I was disappointed because I knew what could have been, but the kids (first timers) hopefully won\\'t remember any of that.',\n",

Even though it's an iconic vacation destination, we found the overall cost of the Disney experience to be VERY high. From the entry fee to the food and beverages and souvenirs inside the park, be prepared to spend a lot of money (even more if you have small children that insist on lots of toys, balloons, snacks, etc.) The high cost of the experience spills outside of the borders of the parks as well and affects nearby lodging and restaurants. Lots of fun, but financially stressful.\",\n",

Fast pass a ride if you can and enjoy another while you wait for your time to return. Easy to get.

Someone should mention to them that Legoland provides areas for kids to play while parents wait in line; and Universal has water fountains in their lines (at least in Florida).On our last visit, so many attractions were closed (are they ever going to finish with Tom Sawyer\\'s island??) and there were also impromptu closures like the Space coaster.I love the classic rides (Peter Pan, Pirates, Haunted Mansion) but I do wish that Disney could make the experience of getting into the rides more magical.',\n",
       " \"After many visits to WDW, we thought we'd try Disneyland. It's smaller and more manageable than WDW, but what a difference in attitude! Disney World is magical and immersive. Disneyland seems to be staffed with a bunch of lackadaisical Californians who just see it as there job. We also encountered a lot of line cutting. One person waits in line and then 10 family members join right before the character meet and greet. This isn't tolerated at WDW and people are asked to go to the back of the line. On our day at California Adventure, we bought our daughter Minnie ears. We left them tucked in the stroller so she could ride Midway Mania and someone stole them. I've never had anything stolen at a Disney Park. Luckily, when I explained what happened to the nearest shop they replaced them for free. Our baby wipes were also stolen at the same time. Who steals baby wipes?!?The Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique was its own mess as our appointment started 45 minutes late, but once it finally got started everything went smoothly. I highly recommend the highest package because your child will get the skip to the front of the princess line (through the staff entrance) and meet all the princesses after she's become one herself. It was wonderful!Overall, the best I can say about our experience is that the weather was great. The classic rides were also fun. Once you get past the less than magical Disneyland vs Disney World experience and accept DL for the more simple experience it is, it's fine. But now that I've visited both within a year, I'm just more of a Disney World person. I'll take a scheduled fastpass that I can schedule on my phone any day compared to waiting in line for almost everything.\",\n",

If you haven't dreamed of going the wonderful world of Disney for years, if you can get over queuing min 20 minutes (even with a fast pass) for a ride and over 60 for those rides without (you can only hold one fast pass at a time), can manage with at least two major rides broken down on the only day you'll ever go - then I'm sure you will love it. For us, we could appreciate the time, creativity and artistry that's gone in to the place - but it's basically a very beautiful and overcrowded human zoo or maybe cattle yard.

There were several rides that broke down while we waited in line which was very disappointing and several more that were being \"revamped\" (but you can google rides out of commission before you go - so at least you know what will be closed) Lots to see and if you really want to enjoy it - give yourselves more than one day - the 3 day pass will give you plenty of time to see it all and double up on some rides that you really liked. BUT, it\\'s Disneyland \"the happiest place on earth\" right...and for some reason buying a $10.00 balloon or paying $5.00 for a corn on the cob seems pretty trivial compared to that smile on your little one\\'s face! Your bags will get searched when you enter - so again be patient -safety first...Oh and don\\'t forget to rent a stroller - lots and lots of walking... we took turns pushing children and adults (not sure that was allowed)...

You don't tell your 6 and 8 year old ids we are going to LA, you say we are going to Disneyland.We got a 4 Day Park Hopper pass. I was originally going to get 3 Day, But it was not much more to get the additional day at the time of booking, and I am glad I did. The one thing about small children is they find it hard to do a full day.Our kids were just the right age. They loved everything about Disneyland. They loved the characters, and got their photos taken with many.We travelled to LA just after Easter (arriving Easter Monday) and the park was still very busy, although many of the workers said it was quiet. We found it quieter the next week.Tips(1) get a 4 Day pass instead of the 3 Day. You can upgrade once there, but it costs more;(2) some food outlets are better than others. Some were really delicious. We found the worst to be the Red Rose Taverne (Part of the Beauty and the Beast section);(3) Fast passes go quickly for the more popular rides. Radiator Springs (in Cars) ran out by lunch time;(4) While the Fact passes are probably linked to an entry card, no one checked. So if there are four of you visiting, you can get four passes. And one person (here the 8 year old) can use them all;(5) Some rides have a line for a single rider, which was good as really only our 8 year old wanted to do many of the rides;(6) Photo pass is great, but we realised too late. If you get a card from the first person to take your photographs, you can link that to the App and they have all photos taken in the park linked. Also many rides take photos. At the exit note the photo code and likewise link it on the App. Then for one fee, you can download all of the photos taken in the Park;\",\n",

Where else do you see people of all kinds, from cute little kids to gaggles of tourists to big tatted up dudes who would seem scary in a dark alley, all grinning like idiots and having a great time? Whether I go on a ride or not, I just like soaking up the happy atmosphere. It can get overcrowded at peak times, and I really recommend avoiding it then unless you are a diehard fan. But the rest of the time it is so fun! Morning and late at night are the best times if you want to avoid crowds.

Space mountain was a little different than the ride in Florida and in Florida there are 2 Dumbo rides but for the most part the parks are almost exactly the same...without the heat in Orlando.Fantasyland seemed a little more cozy in Disneyland and had a few more rides for little ones.The food options at Magic Kingdom are better. We ended up eating dinner at Downtown Disney which had plenty of options. The area is also a short walk from both parks in the area.

Of course with major theme parks there is always a crowd, long wait times, cranky people, and long walks, but with careful planning and using the Disney app we maximized our time there, including California adventures. We had 3 day park hopper tickers, and the convenience of being able to go between the two parks is why we choose park hopper tickets. I had been a little bummed with some rides being worked on and weren't available. Overall a wonderful experience, already planning the next trip to Disneyland! cant wait to return!\",\n",
       " \"we went for 1 1/2 days as it was only a bit more money than 1 day pass, it took the whole 1.5 days for us to do almost everything in the park as it was my kids first visit..the staff was as friendly as you'd expect, and many free buttons to get, like 1st visit, happy birthday, etc that my kids loved! The lines for rides were not too bad, fast pass saved us tons of time, and after 8pm it seemed like almost no lines or wait at most places! Hyperspace mountain is way more turbulent than space mountain in Florida, I got motion sick on it....It got cold at night in april so we needed a jacket or sweatshirt, hot in daytime under the sun, take lots of sunblock, water and hats! They let you take in a few food items like small snacks, granola bars, water, and you can refill water bottles at the water fountains...they don't have any adult beverages at the park BTW but you can leave to go to downtown disney which is connected to the entrance of the park and reenter the park; water bottles at disneyland cost $3.50 in case you forget to take yours! mickey shaped pretzels were very good as was the mickey shaped ice cream bar!\",\n",

And the Tiki room is still the same as always, same with PoC. The down side... lots or rides breaking, and a lot already closed for renovation (how do you plan to have so much closed during spring break... dumb move). The food seems to have gone down hill since the last time, and the response from customer service isn't at all what it used to be. Over all, it was still fun, just not the disney experience I have come to expect. Probably won't bother trying it again to be honest, just not worth the lines and aggravation at that price.\",\n",

Another testament to it\\'s popularity!\\xa0 I\\'ve actually seen this attraction at the Grand California Adventure Theme Park and \"it never drew the crowds that were present this evening!\"As my pictures depict, it was about as crowded as \"the Los Angeles freeway @ peak commute hours!\"\\xa0 There was liberally nowhere to sit!\\xa0 It was standing room only and about 4-5 does deep with spectators!The light show didn\\'t disappoint and started at 8:30PM but didn\\'t reach our end for another 20 minutes! The parade itself was everything I expected it to be and brought back fond memories of yesteryear.\\xa0 I remembered a lot of the original floats and they were just as spectacular \"way back when!\"In conclusion, this added attraction is well worth the price of admission, in my humble opinion.',\n",

       " \"We recently spent 5 days visiting Disneyland and California Adventure Park and it definitely took the full 5 days to fully experience both parks. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Disneyland. I usually don't like rides but there were plenty of rides for me to enjoy. My teenage daughter also enjoyed the rides although the Disneyland rides are, in general, not as adventurous as those in California Adventure Park. We also enjoyed watching the Parade and and the Electrical Parade (at which we had reserved seating as part of the Blue Bayou dinner package). Unfortunately we missed out on the Fireworks as they were cancelled 5 minutes before they were due to begin on the night we went to watch them. There are also a variety of food options from hot dogs and burgers to restaurants and although prices are reasonably expensive we expected this, after all we were on holidays. Lines to some of the rides are quite long but the fast pass system gives everyone (not just those who can afford it) the opportunity to choose a couple of rides each day to not have to queue for. (We also took advantage of the single rider lines where possible). All-in-all we had a great time at the happiest place on earth!\",\n",

       " \"We have been to Disney World in Orlando many times and still found Disneyland very enjoyable. The last time I had been at Disneyland they still used the lettered tickets - so let's just say it had been awhile. The staff is exceptional, we were able to get food quickly and lines were manageable. Being spring break the park was VERY crowded (even on a Tuesday) - so navigating our way through the park felt very congested. We spent one day here and found that to be a good amount of time. We probably could have used another half day. With that said, I also pre-plan our Disney days by visiting Disney's website prior to our trip to make a wish list of the shows and attractions we want to see and do. Once in the park we grab a map and highlight (bring one with you to the park) the numbers of the attractions we want to be sure to include in our day. This saves a lot of time chasing around the park and wondering if you forgot something. As other reviewers suggest - you have to maximize the Fast Pass program. The one ride that I wish that they had a FP for and don't is Peter Pan. It's always a long wait. After the 10:30 fireworks we were able to get on it (waited 35 minutes). If you also like this ride I would recommend going on it first thing (after getting your map and for first FP tickets) or during the afternoon parade. Note that a number of rides in Fantasyland close (temporarily) during the electric light parade and open after the last fireworks. I also found that the Disney app (see their website for the specific one) was very helpful when looking for characters, ride wait times, finding bathrooms, looking at menus etc. - and it's free. We'll go back some day - loved it!\",\n",
       " \"Leave your worries at the gate and just soak this experience in. It's always clean, it always smells good (even when it's packed), everyone is super nice (unless it's time for the parade and you get a couple of cranky employees) and the food is pretty darn good! Here are my tips: go before it opens and wait in line to get in. It really starts to get busy a couple hours after the park opens. Whichever ride is your favorite go to that one first. If you can book at a Disney hotel that offers magic hour ( you get in an hour early) and go early for that. It's makes a huge difference in knocking some of the rides out fast. Side note on that- if you do a hotel with magic hour plan to book around that because it's scheduled days and you don't want to miss out on that! If you want to see the parade find a seat a couple hours early. Take turns watching the spot you pick. It's a great time to do a little shopping. If the parade isn't important, hit those rides. The lines shortens during that time. Fast pass is the best friend you didn't know you had...use it. Dole whip, go inside where the tiki room is the line is tiny. I never understand why people wait so long on the outer line. Plus the tiki show, if you decide to watch it, is a great place to enjoy that dole whip in a shaded and air conditionied place and bonus it's a pretty cute show. Most places will give you complimentary water with ice. It's expensive, it's crowded, the lines can be super long but it's worth it.\",\n",

But they can cut down a 120 minute wait time down to 20 minutes. Having one person in charge of all the tickets with the ability to run up ahead and gather fast passes and keep track of all the times. 2) Know what is going on in the area. For instance, Spring Break of the local schools, things being hosted at the nearby convention center. 3) If coming from out of town, go during the week days. The capacity of the park feels like half the amount of people from weekday to weekend. It changes the experiance completely. 4) If you want to do sit-down restaurants, MAKE RESERVATIONS!

It took us four days to even get to see Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln as it was often closed for some reason.The crowds were unbelievable, even though this was \"supposed\" to be a quiet off-season time at the park. They had something called Annual Passholder days and that may have contributed to the crowds. A local guest said it was as bad as any busy summer day.Overall, we didn\\'t enjoy our visit and that\\'s a sad commentary. If you look at my avatar you will notice it is a Disney castle. We are big Disney fans and always enjoy Disney World. We were very disappointed with our five days out at Disneyland and the California Adventure. I hate to say it, but we won\\'t be going back there after this experience.',\n",
       " 'Very crowded, long lines, high prices, food okay, Worst is when wait in line then after 45 minutes the ride breaks, no recourse. The fastpass is the best way to get around Disneyland. Just need to plan the rides so you can utilize your time as efficiently as possible.',\n",

There was a lot of people but nothing bad, there were bands and music all over the place, food was good, employees were polite, everything worked. After that I have gone several times and some of them good and some of them not that good. This last time I went on a Monday thinking it was going to be pretty empty, I forgot it was the beginning of spring break. It was 8:30 AM and the place was packed already. To my surprise now you have to pass a security check at the parking lot as if you were in an airport. Rude employees, huge lines, stupid rules. Tickets are now horribly expensive, for a family of four expect to pay near 700 just to get in. I spent almost 100 at lunch for the worst hamburgers I have had in a long time, many of the main attractions were closed, one hour lines for each ride, they just don't have a limit on how many people they can handle, rude employees, really think twice about going, it is probably the worst and most expensive vacation I have had in a long time.\",\n",
       " \"We spent 4 days between Disneyland and California Adventure. We have 3 boys 8,11 and 15. We all had a great time and there was something for everyone. It was very busy while we were there with huge wait times for rides but we were amazed at how clean the park was and how smoothly everything ran. The whole park is beautiful and landscaped amazingly well. We have 2 boys with Autism. I can't stress enough how amazing Disney was for our boys. They have a program that helps eliminate long wait times in line and allows you to plan your days easily. I would highly recommend checking out less busy times if crowds make you anxious.\",\n",

Try and come during the start of the work week and not during typical school breaks. It is overwhelming how many people will be there. Another quick tip if you do not wish to do a park Hopper and only want to do a park Hopper keep in mind the rides at Disneyland are directed more towards the adventure as where California adventures is more about the thrill. But Disney land does not offer alcohol like California adventure and downtown Disney do\",\n",
       " 'There is not a whole lot that Disney can do if there are simply too many people, but one thing would be to allow more fast passes. We also visited Walt Disney World and they allow 3 fast passes a day and you can schedule all of them in advance and even on-line and with the app if you have a Disney account (free). Disneyland needs to do something like this. Notwithstanding, we still (as So Cal residents) enjoy making the occasional visit. We love celebrating our anniversary at the Blue Bayou restaurant and have done so 15 or so times. One suggestion: if you want to eat at the Blue Bayou, make your reservations in advance, either on-line on your Disney account or by phone. While they take walk-ins (which we have done a number of times), reservations are best and should be done as much in advance as possible. Understand that a credit card is needed and that if you do not show up, you will be charged $10/person, so plan well. Another suggestion is to arrive at the park early and go to Star Tours first to pick up your fast pass (as that is one of the longer lines) and then go ride other rides and come back. The best times to go are midweek (Mon-Thur) and not during high season. One way to check is to go the the Disney site and look at the blackout days for the various passes. The blackout days tend to be the busier ones, so if a day is blacked out for the passes, I would suggest NOT to pick that day to buy a ticket. Eat a hearty breakfast before you go and share meals in the park to save money.',\n",

       " \"Went to Disneyland for the first time without kids (all grown up). It was actually really fun. No rushing for things and able to really take it all in. The park has changed a lot by adding a lot of Star Wars attractions since I'd last been. There are a couple apps out there to help you really navigate rides and attractions too. Make sure and ride the classic rides as well. Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. still a really good time to be had in the park at any age.\",\n",
       " \"We visited Disneyland and Disney Adventure Park using a 3 day multi park pass (only one park per day but personally I think you'd be crazy to try to do both in one day). We did 2 days at Disneyland and one at Disney Adventure Park. Sunday was much quieter than Monday and Tuesday.Over 3 days in the parks we walked over 55KM so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. For speed and to avoid the interminable queuing get in to the park as soon as you can and dash for a fast pass to one of the big ticket attractions: Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Star Tours or Hyperspace Mountain for instance. Simply present to the ride within the allocated time window and you'll skip most of the queue. Note on your fast pass when you can next get another fast pass. This way you can always have two or three on the go at once. Whilst waiting for the fast pass try some of the other rides which are great too but may not have such crazy queues. Fantasy land is quietest early in the day (even on the busiest day we waited no time for it's a small world, Pinocchio, Mr Toad etc) but gets busier later. There is no fast pass system for Pirates of the Caribbean or Peter Pan, both must do rides, the advantage of no fast passes for these rides is that the queue is genuine and ticks along nicely. For the parades secure your curb side seat early or enjoy a long stand!Food and drink is incredibly expensive ($4.50 for one Churro). We bought tortilla crisps, water and sandwiches at the local CVS pharmacy before entering the park and this helped keep costs down a bit.A little organisation is required to make the most of your visit, spontaneity is definitely over-rated - Enjoy!\",\n",
       " \"You really need to stay for a minimum of 3 days in order to appreciate both parks. The lines are just way too long even with fast passes and Magic Morning. We stay at the Disneyland Hotel so we can walk back and forth the the park and also because you get Magic Morning so you get to do basically 3 rides before the park is over run with a million people. Magic Mornings aren't so magical because getting up at 6am to get ready to get kids fed and dressed for Magic Mornings really doesn't make for a relaxing vacation as you're running from ride to ride before the rush enters the park.\",\n",

We actually had to take a few hour break and go back to our hotel just to get away from the madness.

       " \"My first trip to Disneyland was fantastic. Walt Disney is my idol and I felt like I had to take a trip to his original park. While I do prefer the Florida parks, this one has a charm the Florida ones don't. I liked seeing the characters walk around as if they live there. I loved New Orleans Square, there are a bunch of small things I love about this park that the other location doesn't have, however, there are a few things that just don't make me feel the same love for it. The cast members didn't seem as nice or welcoming as the ones in Florida. The Confectionary doesn't have as many options as Floridas and it's not maintained as well. I did love Disneyland, and some of the attractions are way better here, Its a Small World is the perfect example. If you've never been to the original park you should go at least once, it is very charming and sweet.\",\n",
       " 'Since I have been to DL so many times, I figured I would leave a quick review with some tips for first-time visitors.Disneyland is expensive and crowded. There- I said it. If you can get past those two things, you will have a great time! Over the years I have come to accept that if Disneyland was any cheaper, it would be even MORE crowded, so I suggest treating your trip here as just that- a \"treat\". Know going in that you will spend more money than you are comfortable with, but hey, it\\'s a (potentially) once in a life time experience for a lot of folks. Here are some tips for folks that may help make your day less stressful:- Bring sun screen! It can get hot in So Cal, and if you are like me, it doesn\\'t take much to get burnt to a crisp.- Bring Water/Snacks. As of the last time I went to DL, water and snacks were allowed. Definitely get some food and drinks in the park itself, but make sure you have some supplies on you just in case.- Stop at town hall on the left hand side of the park after you go through the tunnel. They will give you a pin if it is your first visit, birthday, getting married, etc. Make sure you get there early as they run out of pins. When cast members see your pin, they will say something nice to you!- Get there early, and plan on staying late. If you get there just as the park opens, or slightly before, you can easily get on some of the longer-line rides. Take this opportunity to hit up Space Mountain, Star Tours, or Indiana Jones. -Manage your fastpasses! Get one when you enter, and try to be strategic with which ones you get and when you get them. The less you have to walk, the better, so plan out where you want to go, and at what time.- Consider dining at the Blue Bayou. I have gotten reservations the day of, and I think we were lucky to get them. Call ahead to reserve seating, and keep in mind that the restaurant is semi-fine dining, and IMO not a great place to bring small children (unless they are well behaved).-Main street is open for an hours or so after the posted closing time, so you can wait until you leave the park to pick up souvenirs and treats.Enjoy your time and take lots of photos- every trip for me has had some of that trademark Disney magic. Have fun!',\n",
       " \"My daughter and I had a couple of days in Anaheim at the end of a 2 week trip to LA, and considering we went to Tokyo Disneyland only a couple of months ago, we had the luxury of skipping some of the rides in Disneyland that we had already been on and didn't need to go on again. So we opted for a 1 day park hopper. I realise that's the most expensive option, but I didn't want to spend another USD100 for us to have a 2nd day just for the sake of making it a more economic option.Even so, I really can't see how Disneyland can justify charging USD179 each (AUD255) to stand in huge lines waiting. Yes, I realise now it was spring break. But a theme park should be able to handle its busiest times, and I really don't think Disney can. Or is it that everyone just loves standing in lines and queuing for things? That was one thing that my daughter and I couldn't believe - the lines of people queuing for absolutely everything. Maybe queuing is something that Australians just don't like to do?Based on recommendations from friends, we made sure we were at the gate by 7.30ish, lining up with everyone else. As soon as the park opened, we went straight to California Adventure Park to get some rides in before heading over to Disneyland at 10.30am.We immediately got a Fast Pass for the Indiana Jones ride - glad we did, because it was still a 5-6 hour wait until we could use it. And when we did, we immediately got a 2nd FastPass. It's a bit deceiving by skipping what you think is the queue, when you hand in your FP. But there is still quite a long way to go after that point, and still lots of queuing to do. Despite this, it was our favourite ride.During the course of the day, we got FastPasses where we could, but otherwise didn't wait in lines any longer than 30 minutes. So that means that we missed out on some rides that we would have really liked to go on (like Pirates). We thought the crowds would die down towards the end of the night, but even at 11pm, the stand-by line for Indiana Jones was still over an hour.The food offerings were expensive - USD10.75 (AUD15) for a pack of caramel popcorn? Thanks but no thanks. If I went again, I would definitely take my own food.Comparing Disneyland to its counterpart in Tokyo, we would go back to Tokyo in a heartbeat - so much cleaner, more spacious, less crowded, much shorter lines.Overall, I was disappointed with the day, and won't bother coming back next time I'm in the US.\",\n",
       " 'We visited Disneyland in late March and early April and had a fantastic time with our family. There is plenty to do over the course of several days and a variety of rides for all ages and interests. The Electric Light Parade was a fun blast from the past.

The park is far too crowded making getting around a pain, especially with kids. If you want to see a parade or fireworks, you have to stake out your spot at least an hour in advance. The lines were always an hour long. Reservations for some rides were 8 hours later. The whole day was like shopping at the mall at Christmas...too may people, too much money, not much fun.

Once we stood in line for more than 40 minutes to get in, we were sent back OUT of the park to the rental booth.

She asked if I had a \\'card\\'. I said, \"No, you didn\\'t give me one when I was here 10 minutes ago.\" She told me I would have to go all the way back through the LONG line to get back into the park!@! I asked how I would know I needed a \\'card\\' when she clearly didn\\'t give me one. She said that she \\'didn\\'t remember me\\' and turned her back on me. I was furious and asked for her supervisor. Another employee nearby - not looking at me said, \"go to the other line\". And that was that. The day was RIDICULOUS. There were so many people in the park we could not even walk; let alone keep our family together. Rides? HA!

Also, the Haunted Mansion was magical. 3 adults will NOT fit easily in the ride together though. Also, Space Mountain's special Halloween show- awesome!

       " \"We visited Disneyland on Thanksgiving which I think was probably one of the busiest days at the park. Since we don't celebrate this holiday in Australia I don't think we quite understood its significance. The park is open from early about 8am until midnight. It is has been one of my dreams to visit Disneyland ever since I was a child and watched the wonderful world on a Sunday night. Being a fan of theme parks I was excited to go to the original and it was the best. Granted it was quite expensive to get in nearly $300 for a two day pass, but it is extremely well run. The staff were excellent and so friendly, engaging with guests. The park was pristine there was no litter anywhere and if a parade had confetti it was cleaned up straight after. The food was reasonable in price and they had plenty of fountains to refill your water bottles. It was very crowded though I think that had a lot to do with the holiday and there was long lines to go on the most popular rides. The rides were worth the wait, unlike rides at Australian theme parks, they go for a long time and are the product of a lot of imagination. We went on Space Mountain, the Indiana Jones ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, two boat rides, one that went through miniature villages of Disney movies including Aladdin & Frozen and a jungle one that went past different animatronic animals. We also went on the famous teacups which was part of my childhood dream though the more you spin the faster they go which leads to dizziness! There are lots of people that go to Disneyland and it seems like many families make it part of the annual vacations, with families wearing matching shirts, with their names, well, Mum, Dad, Nanna, little brother and big sister etc on them. There were also a lot of people in wheelchairs and mobility scooters, that you can hire at the park. I'm not entirely convinced that all the people using these facilities were actually disabled as those with mobility issues get priority in the lines and take along their family of 10 people along, so it seemed to me that it was a sneaky way to not have to wait in the queues, which at times were over an hour wait. If you are staying at the Disney Resort there is a complimentary fast pass, that allows you to jump the queue for each ride, but if you want to go again are given a time at which to return, which is fair enough.We enjoyed the parade & waited nearly 3 hours for the fireworks over the castle which was then cancelled due to the wind, though it was not really that windy. That was most disappointing as our feet were sore after a big day walking around, and if we knew that there was going to be no fireworks we would have gone to either the laser show at the California Adventure park which is the sister park or gone back to our accommodation.We caught the ART bus there which was $5.50 per adult for 1 day, of $14 for 3 days. It was a good way to get around Anaheim and the drivers were excellent, the lady on our way there helped a lady in a wheelchair onto the bus, she was very professional.I was so happy to be able tick this off my bucket list and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting the wonderful world of Disney.\",\n",
       " 'The good:Disney still does a lot of things well. They have fantastic shows, such as fireworks, parades, and live music everywhere. The Electric Light Parade is back and it\\'s fantastic! Don\\'t miss this but wait for the 10:30 show and skip the 8:30 show because it\\'s a lot easier to find a good place to sit (yes, sit!) and you can see more.The fireworks are also fantastic, as usual, but get a spot where you can see the castle. They now have pictures beamed on the castle like it\\'s a screen so it\\'s cool.The old classic rides are still here and are fantastic, but the reliable \"fastpass\" system seems to have failed. When there are huge crowds, you have at least a one-hour wait in a standby line or you get the fastpass and have to return 7-8 hours later. In some cases, the passes were gone very quickly. The bad:I\\'ve visited this park many times, starting in 1979. I even had an annual pass one year back in 2000. Maybe it was because I went during spring break and it was overcrowded and thus, it was miserable. The rides had mostly 1-hour waits and there were so many people everywhere you went. Rides broke down daily, which just added to the misery. I would have to think very hard about visiting again anytime soon, and certainly not during spring break. Never, ever, ever, do this!

Indiana Jones is the absolute best by far, pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted Mansion were awesome as well. For me, once being inside, it was little to do with the rides.

The entrance to the park is forced through downtown Disney and a TSA like probe.....Entering the park does not seem magical at all, where is the music and the happy people? The attractions were nice and I appreciate the rides were different than Orlando even the rides with the same names had variations that make it worth the trip.The food seems much more expensive a slice of pizza for 8 bucks rather than the ability to purchase a whole pizza for 20 is insane. So smiles from the cast they all seem beat down and depressed.The park offers little shade and it's miserable walking around in the afternoon.

       " \"Disney is a great family park. We recommend arriving early because it can get super packed. We recommend buying your tickets on line and print them at home. It's a less line you have to do. They now have fast passes next to some attraction. Keep in mind not all the attractions have this. We recommend doing this to save time, it tells you what time you can just walk in the attraction without doing those long lines. When it comes to food don't forget to have the Dole Whip Float it's so good and refreshing. For lunch we recommend the Rancho del Zocalo restaurante. It's Mexican food at a very affordable price.  At night they have the Electrical parade , this is not a big deal. Its a bummer because they block all the mayor streets, so if you want to go to an attraction they make you do a big turn to get where you want. I must say this sucks if you are tired. So on this same note wear comfy shoes , trust me. The night show that we recommend not missing is the fireworks and world of color show. This is so beautiful. All in all this trip was very fun.\",\n",
       " \"Let's face it, this is The Happiest Place on Earth. With that said we had a fun time. We did bring our own snacks and water so that we wouldn't have to take the time to stop and eat. We spent 12 hours at both parks and got to ride numerous rides. Yes it was busy but the crowds were manageable and we all had a great time.\",\n",
       " \"We went during spring break and it was busy but never stood in line for more than 40 min. Disneyland is the master of lines keeping you entertained while making them look small.The three things you will NEED is the park hopper pass, Disneyland app and your phone with data. The app show closed attractions, washrooms, length of lines, fast pass times and where and when Characters can be found. Fast passes will ensure you do not spend your vacation standing in lines. We had our older son who would run ahead and get our fast pass then we would go to the other park and get a fast pass there. Then we would plan our rides based on lineup times until we could use our fast pass and get another. We did 5 days and only had a couple of rides we wanted to do on day 5 and spent allot of the day repeating our favorite ones. We rented strollers for the two little girl's 6 and under. This is a must because you cover a lot of ground in a day. We left all our stuff in the strollers and never had any issues until the last night when someone grabbed the wrong stroller after the fireworks. We got all our stuff back the next morning except 1 souvenir cup ( they throw out any containers that contain or possibly contain liquids). Disneyland did replace the cup free of charge which was fantastic. This trip can be expensive with the dollar exchange but is a must for families. My recommendation would be to take kids when they are between 6 an 10 as they can ride almost any ride and they really appreciated the magic of the park.\",\n",
       " \"Took my niece for her birthday. If you tell the person when you are buying the tickets they will give you a button and you can write your names and stuff on them. So they have buttons for like birthdays and weddings etc. We went on a day that it was supposed to rain all day. There wasn't a drop. It was crowded but I guess it wasn't as bad as normal. Works for me!\",\n",
       " \"We go every two years and LOVE it. The happiest place on earth for sure! Make sure you utilize the Fast Pass system during the middle of the day. You'll get a lot of rides in if you can get there early and stay late.\",\n",
       " 'Our visit to Disneyland was so that our grandsons could \"meet\" the characters that they know from TV and movies. They loved every ride that they were on, though we didn\\'t make it to all of the rides during our 2 days in the park. Our visit was during Spring Break season and it was often difficult to navigate through areas of the park due to the crowd size. We managed to snag a prime spot for the Electric Parade on our 2nd night and were thankful for the front row view.',\n",
       " 'We always drive here for 3 day weekends. It can be crazy and crowded but my family has a great time all the time. My daughter has always been able to see her favorite characters and even got them to sign her birthday card when we went for her 5rh birthday.',\n",
       " 'Disneyland by far surpassed my expectations, sounds silly but at the age of 35 brought tears to my eyes! Watching my childrens face when we walked through the gates was next level! Just amazing......Disneyland needs to be on everyones bucket list - young or old you need to see this place!',\n",
       " \"Tickets ($124) are expensive considering you have to pay for anyone's over 3, in addition to $20.00 for parking. Would recommend Disney World in Florida any day over Disney land, for the monies you pay. Lines were way too long for popular rides (in mid-March) - waited a minimum of an hour each ride. Kids were getting pretty tired. Ended up covering only Magic Kingdom. Missed out on visiting Tomorrow Land, Frontier Land, and Adventure Land. Electric parade was A+++ - worth the wait (about two hours in advance for a good viewing area seating for the 8:30 parade).It's Small World was great. Peter Pan was not worth the wait.\",\n",
       " 'It was so crowded that it was very difficult to ride rides. The employees there are not near as friendly as in Disney World. We were there celebrating my daughters 16th birthday. We were told that if she wears a button the employees will say happy birthday etc and make it special. This was not the case at all. None of them ever said Happy birthday. They were rude on the monorail as well as the Car rides. The one employee on Luginies ride made it special by having people in line sing happy birthday. Disney World the employees help make the experience wonderful and are so helpful.',\n",
       " 'This is where the Disney theme parks started. Not to be missed. At times VERY crowded. Fantastic shows, OK food, some great attractions - and you get to meet the Disney characters - a must for the kids',\n",
       " \"We are annual pass holders. Disneyland is expensive but amazing. Depending on the time of year you go, it can be less crowded. The park is decorated for Halloween and Christmas but Christmas is the absolutely most crowded time of the year. Some rides need to be upgraded, especially the Matterhorn. I understand it's a classic but the ride is very uncomfortable.\",\n",

       " \"My wife and I had never been here before, so we decided to take our kids for their first time. I knew it was going to be overcrowded and I knew the lines were going to be long. That wasn't what disappointed me. We went on a Tuesday, at the beginning of March. It was not spring break time, yet it was very crowded. With how much the entry tickets are and the thousands of people that were there, I figured Disney could afford to have more of the Disney characters just walking around strictly for meet and greet/ pictures. One that we did see out and about was Mickey. We joined the line that had formed, but after about 5 minutes another employee walked up, stopped at the group in front of me, and then told me that the line ended at that group. There was my family and another family behind us - Don't know why they wouldn't stop the line after us two groups and stay there to alert anyone else from joining the line --- BEFORE they joined. They only had two Disney princess characters available during the time that said they would be there. The lines are deceiving! They make it look like the line is short, but hide half of the line in the props and what not so you can't see how long it actually is. Aside from the, my family still enjoyed our visit, there are just things that we learned and know what to do differently whenever we return.\",\n",
       " \"This was our first visit and we can't wait to come back! The lines were long but they were worth it every time! We did the fast past on some of the rides and that was great. The magic morning helped a lot as well with wait times. We got to me Mickey at his house and Moana as well storm troopers.This was such a magical vacation!\",\n",
       " \"After many visits to Disney World we made our first trek to Southern California to take in Disneyland. The park is similar to Magic Kingdom in layout and design. The park is clean and safe and has plenty of Disney Magic. The castle is not the scale of Cinderella's castle at DW but it is an Icon itself being the first. If you're a Disney fan this is a must because this is the only park Walt himself had his hands on. There are numerous rides and shows but my favorite thing was near the entrance at the Lincoln building you can see the bench and a horse from the carousel that Walt sat on when he would take his kids and dreamed up the Disney resorts. Incredible!\",\n",

       " 'We planned a 3 day vacation to Disneyland ( we are SERIOUS Disney fans) but I have to say- this was a total let down. Everything we wanted to ride was broken. Then we waited for 1.5 hours for Space Mountain ( in the heat) then all of a sudden it was down with \" no estimated time\" for it to be back up! Then we heard it had already been down 2 times before. We had gotten Fast Passes to Indiana Jones ( everyone gets fast pass, another disappointment- because then what\\'s the point?!!), after we waited for our time ( which was 3 hours later) the ride was down!The crowds were ridiculous and it was total chaos! We won\\'t be returning here again, instead we will stick to the parks in Orlando.We won\\'t use our 3 day passes at all, we opted to go other places......',\n",

The lines are long and the employees are no longer happy to be there. A 10 hour visit yields 7 rides. Save your money and take the kids to the beach. He'll enjoy it just as much\",\n",
       " '.. cos daughter was slightly unwell when we arrived at Anaheim and had to cut down our theme park time from 2 days to 1 day. Also, it was a wise decision (based on wonderful feedback gathered from TA) to spend the entire day at Disneyland instead of a park hopper ticket to try cover both parks. Tons of activities in Disneyland alone to cover in a single day.',\n",
       " \"How does Disneyland not have all 5 star reviews? It's honestly a highlight of my month whenever we go. Every time we find new places to eat and ways to make the day less stressful/exhausting. They hire perfect employees- I honestly never have interacted with any that weren't incredibly pleasant. Just walking up to the park fills me with happiness because the music they play. They've got nostalgia on lock down. Can't wait to go again and I'm 32. Not to mention, the character actors are GREAT! As you can imagine, wonderful with children. My daughter adores meeting any of them and it's all she talks about when we get home.\",\n",

       " \"Although I'm a lifelong Disney park fan, and there's still so much they do right, I couldn't help but feel Disneyland is going a little downhill in 2017. Many people, including hoteliers and cast members, agreed they have never seen the park this busy, and we haven't even hit peak times of the year. Add to the crowds the frequently broken major rides across both CA Adventure and Disneyland, and you have a bunch of disappointed people who want to love Disneyland.During my 5-day stay, Sat thru Wed, we saw all major rides down for hours on end except for Pirates, thank God. On our hottest day Wed, with temps approaching 80F, both Splash Mountain and Grizzly Rapids were down most of the day. We experienced many rides chronically open and close within a single day. On one day, every major ride with a few exceptions was closed for at least an hour.With construction for the Star Wars Land (Walt is cursing in his grave I'm sure), and huge crowds, crowd control was rough from sunset until closing, due to parades and fireworks. Although it's fantastic to have the Main St Electrical Parade back, the crazy crowd control patterns are nuts and extremely prohibitive. Somebody should be studying those to find a better way. A tunnel under the castle from Tomorrowland to Frontierland would solve many problems. The main men's bathroom in the bottom half of Adventureland was under construction, leaving huge lines in Frontierland. Overall, whoever is approving crowd control plans should be fired, and replaced with someone who understands the patterns, the need for bathrooms, and parade issues. It was painful.The groundskeepers are still top notch, and cast members are almost uniformly helpful and friendly, so there are still things to celebrate. But if Disney doesn't get on top of crowd control (e.g. Triple the local and annual prices), the luster could dim.\",\n",
       " \"Be there maybe as early as 6 am. Magic Morning isn't magic at all. Lines are crazy. Not all rides are open and no restaurant or food stall open early. Better bring your own food and water. Use fast pass for popular rides. Popular rides are open until 12 midnight. It is better to wait late at night for those rides.\",\n",
       " 'We did not know it was the beginning of Spring Break and only did One park. The wait times were decent on a weekend, but heard the crowds are coming during the week. The construction was quiet but virtually half of my favorites were closed. No Matterhorn, No train, No rivers of the Americas. No Bumblebee Lemon Cupcakes..... Guardians of the Galaxy will open in May at California Adventure, so we will invariably be back.',\n",
       " \"I was given the task of taking my sister, brother-in-law and niece (age 3) to Disneyland. I had never been myself but had been to Walt Disney World. I did my research and thought it would be a visit on par with WDW. For the most part, it was. The system of moving people effectively from parking lots to the park were the same. The through effort with a lost lunch at lost and found, was exactly the type of dedicated to details that I was expecting. Cast mates friendly and helpful as well. Physically going to the attraction for a fastpass was let down but we made that work. No fastpasses for meeting characters was disappointing especially with little kids. The one aspect I missed out on at WDW was purchasing a photopass, this time I made sure to buy ahead of time. Despite using the app we were only able to find photographers three times all day. We were there from 9:20 am til almost 8:00. Such a disappointment. Even had the girls hair done at Cinderella's boutique, no photographers. WDW had at least three stationed there in comparison. I guess if you don't mind the lack of fast passes and were not planning on the Photopass, it is still a magical place.\",\n",

Just step inside and see for yourself. I have loved Disney since my first visit as a child 30 years ago, but love it more today. I think, as one grows older and inherent childhood innocence is lost, one needs its magic even more. We have to be reminded to lighten up and just be happy!

The value it brings me is priceless.If I could afford it, I would have every holiday with Disney. I would go on a Disney cruise, stay in their resorts and spend every moment in their parks. I have been fortunate enough to have travelled the world and lived a full life. But now I realise, life is about being happy, and having precious moments with the ones you love. Disney, simply put, is my happy place.',\n",
       " \"I went to both parks, Disneyland Park and California Adventure.Pros: Good parking structure, Rides, Attractions, snacksCons: Too many people, good food hard to find, price, waiting times for rides.Overall it's a great park, but it's not perfect. This was my first time. You need to visit at least three days to be satisfied. Otherwise, you'll miss some cool rides due to waiting time to get in. Food is bad inside the park. I got sick the whole time due to all the snacks I ate. I like how they have the parking layout and very organized as well as taking the tram to the parks. For SoCal residents, I encourage you to get the 3-day deal because it's worth it.\",\n",

       " \"We visited the Happiest Place on Earth on Match 13 and 14 2017. It is widely known by all including Disney that this week was spring break in Arizona and other states that people flock from to go to DL.Tuesday the 14th was extremely crowded and hot. Guess what only 1 monorail running that day. WHY?My wife's back was really hurting her so she was going to take monorail back to downtown Disney to go to our room at the DL hotel and walk.She waited 1 hour before she was able to take the monorail!!Disney is usually known for having their ducks in a row and all their bases covered.Not this time with only 1 monorail operating at this very very busy time is very poor planning.\",\n",
       " 'My first visit experience: This place is super duper crowded and so freaking expensive. I had very high expectations and was very disappointed. We spent 3 days here and every single day was horrible due to how crowded it was. We literally spent like an hour waiting for rides that were each less than 5 minutes long. I cannot understand why the Disney company would allow so many people to enter the park and let it become hell on earth. I cannot believe people put up with such bs from Disney with how pricey those entrance tickets are.I always heard that the park is always clean and bathrooms too. Nope, thats not accurate there was so many people that those bathrooms were pretty filthy.I cannot understand why the food which is of cheap quality would be so expensive. There is not many places where you can sit and rest. Also we tried watching the parade and fireworks but there was nowhere to go and see it. Many people take up all the good viewing spaces for the parade and fireworks a few hours prior to the show. So if you want to see it from a good place make sure you are there at 5pm. On our third and final day we had given up on this family vacation. We left early to our hotel and decided to just rest from all the horrible things that happened at Disney. Never again Disney. First and last time visiting unless they can change and find a solution for the overcrowding issue.',\n",

       " \"We were very excited to visit Disneyland after going to a couple other Disney parks (one being overseas). Unfortunately, we were ultimately disappointed. The rides were very dated for most of the park and the workers weren't up to the level that they were at Disney World. California Adventure Park, on the other hand, was very well done and a good experience. Disneyland is very small and we were debating between going here and Universal Studios. In hindsight, we were probably better off going to Universal Studios in lieu of this but our curiosity got the better of us. There are simply too many people and not enough rides. The lines are ridiculous - which we expected - and there is a crazy amount of people there with small infants (many less than 4-6 months old) and toddlers with strollers in such a small space. Disneyland is definitely showing it's age - I would skip the park and go to California Adventure if you must go to the park. The lines are terrible there too - but the environment is much nicer.\",\n",

       " 'Was disappointed this year on our trip to Disneyland this year. We celebrated their 60th anniversary in 2016 but this year was less than stellar. Some of the really good ride was \"closed for refurbishment\". This included the Matterhorn, Grizzly, Railroad, Mark Twain\\'s paddle boat ride. On the plus side they brought back the Electric Parade. Haven\\'t seen that in years. The Frozen show was worth the wait. It was definitely a hoot for everyone young and old. The food was great especially the corn dogs! We were disappointed with the Terrace Italian restaurant. When we approached for dinner they advised we should book ahead. I asked how would we know to book ahead we were tourists! Anyway, despite the issues it is always a good trip to Disneyland!',\n",
       " 'We had a great time at the park but it was a little more crowded than we expected. But the lines were still not too long of a wait. Most lines went much faster than the stated waiting time.',\n",
       " \"We surprisingly got through quite a bit during our day there. It was hot and busy, but we didn't wait more than 45 minutes for anything as we utilized the Fast Pass system.\",\n",
       " \"Had a decent time still as it is the magic of Disney but the crowds are becoming intolerable. Everything in the park runs seamlessly in terms of cleanliness and service except when it comes to crowds. We went on a Sunday and there were parts of the park where foot traffic came to a halt for extended periods of time. In the 8 hours we were there, I was hit by 3 strollers and 1 electric wheelchair! I don't know why Disney doesn't at least assign some if it's many staff to help manage crowd control and direction of traffic if they are going to jam the parks to the brim. We were only able to go on 5 rides even with Fast Passes, making each ride cost $44 each for two people. In the rides where Fast Passes were not available, we waited 40-110 minutes. We were not even allowed throw money at any of the restaurants because they were taking reservations only. While we saw that reservations could be made online the day before, there was nothing to indicate that they were required. When we were able to purchase food from the casual cafes, there was no place to sit. We took our tray to another area where we found half a bench. In addition some popular attractions such as the Matterhorn were closed. Really love the rides and charm that the park has to offer but it's becoming too straining on patience to come here. May just avoid the park altogether next time and only go to Downtown Disney. I'm sure if you planned your trip out on strategic days, reservations, and wait times, ran and pushed people when you could, you would be able to hit some type of agenda in the park even with the crowds. But it is just not worth it for us. It seems you need to be very determined and very well researched on park strategy to come here now.\",\n",
       " 'I loved Disneyland Park. The \"original\" disneyland. It is filled with all he old school rides that you have heard about over the years like the matterhorn and space mountain. These rides are great and seeing the Princesses pink castle is a must do however if you have older kids who are thrill seekers then California Park is a better choice. This park is amazing but more suited to younger kids who want to witness the magical side of disneyland with all of the characters and the star dust and sparkles! You could do this park in 6 hours. California needs 8 - 10!',\n",
       " \"My wife and I visited Disneyland today. We tend to visit every few years but this will be the last visit until things change. It's always busy but today was impossibly busy likely due to Spring Break. But if this were any other business it would be shut down for being over occupancy numbers. This is a tragedy waiting to happen. There is literally no space to walk especially as ride lines become extended and further block available walking space. God forbid someone had an emergency or some major event happened.What I truly don't understand is why they be doing repairs on some rides if they know this is the busiest time of the year. Also, they claim to raise the prices in the busy season but I'm not at all convinced this is really done to reduce crowds. If they wanted to reduce crowds that would simply put quota on ticket sales and guests entering the park. Force people to make reservations (lottery if necessary) and reduce same day ticket sales/entries.The park was an overcrowded mess today. With rides closing down constantly (we had a stretch where we went to 4 rides consecutively with fast passes and each ride was closed down for repairs), lines weaving everywhere it was often very difficult to try to understand where the line actually started, long lines for food and bathrooms, etc. It was comically annoying and actually quite pathetic and I kept wondering why I had paid so much for this. It felt very overrated.Disney badly needs to stop thinking about only making money and actually try to think about providing a quality experience again and this will begin with crowd control. As far as I can tell they currently don't have any quotas or restraints on park entries and the fastpass system broke down today on multiple occasions. The park just couldn't handle the number of people within its boundaries and the most popular rides were pushed to their brink which ultimately led to many breakdowns. As for me, I will be spending my money elsewhere. This has become the tourist trap of all time tourist traps.\",\n",
       " 'Had a family day there for the first time and it was BEAUTIFUL! The Star Wars section was indeed my favorite. Rides were great and I dont even like roller coaters haha! The parade was beautiful aswell! We did go on the weekend so it was PACKED! Would of loved to ride more rides but it was indeed a great trip!',\n",

       " \"This was Disneyland's 60th anniversary celebration. Good food (turkey leg), the parade was nice, but get a spot early. It was a convention evening pass so lines limited ride attempts. Went with Nemo for a slow one and Indiana Jones for an active one. Good choices. The best things for an older dude like me are the photo ops and the Main Street shops. Too much shake, rattle and roll is not good. Worth the visit.\",\n",
       " \"We have been to Disney World numerous times and Disney Paris. We thought it was time to visit where it all started. We all enjoyed the park. You get your classic Disney rides. Rides that I remember from when I was young but have closed at Disney World, like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and Snow White's Scary Adventures. And of course there are the new rides that are also great. The new Pirate's of the Caribbean opened on our last day and it was fantastic! My only negative is that Disney needs to invest some money into their older rides to make them more reliable. We spent a lot of wasted time in line. We would get to the front of the line where there were only a few parties waiting to get onto the ride in front of us and then the ride would close due to technical difficulties. This happened to us on Pinocchio, Haunted Mansion, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. We did get a pass to ride another ride when this happened on Haunted Mansion, or at least we thought we did, they load it onto one ticket from your party but when we went to use it the ride person said there was nothing on any of our tickets.\",\n",
       " \"Top attractions Matterhorn, Railroad, Riverboat and several others are closed for refurbishment. They need it, as they keep stopping. Evacuation procedures are awful, needing more than a half hour to get people off a stopped ride. They don't advise about the closed rides before you buy a ticket, but that is part of the Disney culture: grab as much money as they can. There are lots of other people who will keep the lineups full. You need lots of patience and ways to entertain kids in hour-long lineups.\",\n",
       " \"We recently went to Disney for the first time as a family. I knew that going over spring break would mean long lines and more people, but I was very disappointed with just how many people.we had 3 day passes. Our first day we entered the park at open and when we had left we had made it on 2 rides and seen 3 characters. We were there 8-4 (8 hours). It was ridiculous. It was so packed we could barely get food to eat, visit gift shops for souvenirs, and definitely couldn't do many rides. Wait times were 60+ minutes and fast passes were sold out till 6-8pm. I'm very sad and disappointed that Disney doesn't put some kind of cap on how many people can be in the park at one time. It definitely wasn't the happiest place on earth!\",\n",
       " \"Just returned from a Disney trip during our Spring Break. The family had been to the Orlando Parks a few times but had not been to Los Angeles. Thank god for the extra time in the park Extra Magic Hours that came with staying in a Disney hotel. We did the majority of what we wanted to do between 7:00 & 9:00 am. Star Tours was great. Pirates was closed the day we were there, so we didn't get to see the revised ride. The Park is in really good shape. Disney is still magical.But the place shows its age in the narrowness of its walkways. By 10:00am, the place was packed, and it is overrun with strollers and scooters. We will not go again during any school holiday.\",\n",
       " \"We had fun, for sure. But with the train that runs the perimeter closed down we couldn't rest our legs and still get to some of the furthest places in the park. Plus last time we were there, Pirates was closed and now it was closed AGAIN! So we still haven't been on that ride. Plus the Matterhorn was also closed, so we didn't get to ride that past favorite roller coaster. But yes, we still had fun doing the things that we were able to do, even though the crowds were so big and the lines were so long! We got a fast pass for Indiana Jones, so that helped some, but it was still a long line. The revised Space Mountain - now called Hyper Space Mountain, was broken down most of the day, but got repaired in time for a late night ride (with a 20 minute delay due to another breakdown while we were in line). But it was fun once we got to it. By then it was late and we couldn't make it over to Splash Mountain without the train, so we missed that ride. It's still the happiest place on earth, but it could have been so much better if things were ALL working!\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I took our three-year-old son to Disneyland this week and for the most part we all had an amazing time (thank goodness we planned for afternoon naps back at the hotel every day… Best decision we ever made!) Of course, Disneyland is the classic institution of Southern California that is the realization of Walt Disney's dream. The castle still stands stalwart in the middle of the park and as a 50-year-old woman who grew up coming here over the course of my life I couldn't help but reflect about this place as it operates now in 2017. I think I hold a mental model of this park that comes from a little girl's brain from long ago. This week, what I saw was a small castle, an old park with narrow walkways that aren't capable anymore of handling the throngs of people that show up for the nighttime shows. The cast members do their best to control the crowds with their light lamps and ropes. They hustled us along like cattle at one point where we were ankle to ankle. No longer was I able to meander over to storybook land and peruse the shops because, when I went, storybook land was closed for the fireworks show and I was stuck with a stroller in a massive crowd of people that were being corralled down Main Street. I think that Disney has done its best with retrofitting parts of the park and keeping their classic rides current, clean, and updated. That being said, the crowd control is very problematic. Strollers are parked three deep all through tomorrow land and crowds are roped off so that one-way traffic can be encouraged all along the tomorrowland walkway. I can see how the company is trying to think innovatively about helping people navigate the park and I appreciate that. But with Star Wars land opening next year, I can't help but wonder how Disney will handle the influx of people, especially onto beautiful, but tiny little bottlenecked Main Street.One important thing that we learned was how to work the fast pass system. Without that, rides would have been very challenging to get on even in mid-March. We also had a four day park hopper which allowed us to use the magic morning hour. The magic morning allows you to enter the park one hour before opening. That was very nice as we were able to walk onto Buzz Light Year's Astro Blasters ride twice before the park opened. This meant a lot to my son. Finally, our experience with the Disney characters was spotty at best. Mickey Mouse on Main Street hurried us through the line and did no interaction with our son. It was definitely an assembly line. Disheartening, as he loves Mickey Mouse. It's interesting to see that the days of walking up to a character and getting a picture taken with them are long gone. Everywhere characters appeared lines of picture takers quickly formed. We even waited 25 minutes in line to get a picture with Darth Vader (Who, ironically, was very nice). :-)We also found a pattern of curtness with several of the cast members this trip. Many were still very helpful and sweet to our son though and I want to make sure to mention that. After these experiences, I can't help wonder, why?For me, some of the larger questions loom. How is this company building it's culture for its employees? What is their morale like? Why are the characters hesitant to dive in and interact? Why are they moving kids through the lines so quickly? There was something sad about that to me. Something that speaks of a very subtle loss of culture for this timeless and classic Los Angeles amusement park that has always been loved by so many.Surprisingly, it was a totally different vibe at California Disney. We got a fast pass for World of Color which we would highly recommend. The crowd control here was much better. We had plenty of room to stand in our assigned location. There are open eateries all through California Disney making lines short and food highly accessible. Plenty of seating areas and the rides were extremely well-run. The park was clean and the rides carried that beautiful imaginative Spirit of Disney but were much more modern and the way they were designed. The cast members of California Disney were consistently courteous, professional and friendly.Some of the pluses of our overall experience: Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain Railroad, Pirates of the Caribbean are all still running beautifully. My son loved them. Loved Buzz Light Year's Astro Blasters and, of course, Peter Pan. We love the fried chicken at the Plaza Inn on Main Street. As for California Disney, we would highly recommend the nighttime show world of color. The Ferris wheel is magnificent, and the redwood ropes course is great for little kids!With some careful planning, some strategic use of the fast pass system, and some expectations for some big crowds, you can still have a fantastic time at Disneyland, even in 2017.\",\n",
       " \"We went 3/13 - 3/16 & crowds were extreme. I thought it would be a little less crowded but I was wrong. We still managed to get in a lot of rides but I missed being able to ride much in Tomorrowland, only small world and buzz light year. Very sad that we didn't have the time or energy to stand in line for space mountain and Peter pan. We also missed autopia and star tours. Pirates opened last day of our stay and once the worked the bugs out, we were able to stand in a 45 minute line for the ride.\",\n",
       " 'We rented strollers and our 2- year- old fell asleep while his big sister (5) rode rides that he was too little for. Both kids enjoyed the various boat rides and shows.

With all the hype I half-expected gems and gold leaf or personal attendants to dust my shoes after each ride - alas, it's just an amusement park. If you've been to others this is probably nicer albeit more crowded. So many strollers, dodging them could be the most challenging event of the day. Food is good quality but higher in price than warranted. Healthy choices are always available, even for the kiddos. Be prepared for some rides to be closed for cleaning and refurbishment. Download the app for all the wait times at your fingertips. Take advantage of the FastPasses wherever you see them. If you have a full day to spend you'll have seen enough a second day isn't needed. If you have a second day for amusement, spend it at Universal, or skip Land and hit Adventure and Universal instead.\",\n",
       " \"Instead of the day, we visited the park at night so we could see the elusive Main Street Electrical Parade. It's better than what I remembered a few years ago, but some of the attractions were (again) closed due to problems. I'm talking specifically about Hyperspace Mountain, which never seems to be open when we are there. We rode Autopia in the dark, but that's not exactly thrilling with the crowds.\",\n",

Don't get me wrong, I love Disneyland and will return, but come on people, this is and has been for many years, one of the greatest family entertainment spots in the world. When you plan a trip to a theme park, you've got to expect crowds, wait lines, $10 ice cream cones, and excited children! Slow down and enjoy it.\",\n",
       " \"What more do I need to say? It's the happiest place on earth! We had a blast. It was not overly crowded, but quite a few rides were under maintenance. We knew that beforehand. One thing of note, we were in line to ride Peter Pan late after the parade, and it went down for more than 45 minutes. Upon leaving, a cast member was handing out ride passes. The passes were good for any ride. Also, I asked if the pass could be dated for the next day. No problem! The pass was good for up to 6 people. Great fun!\",\n",

The staff are very well trained and organised, and despite the fact that they have to face a daily onslaught of thousands and thousands of people they manage to present Disneyland the way it should be. We were disappointed by some of the rides not being available (maintenance) but that has to happen sometimes. The crowds were huge, but they always are and Disneyland manages them amazingly well. The food items we purchased through the day were a lot better quality than I had been expecting (a lot better!)If you come to LA, Disneyland is a must visit place, at least once, with or without children- although I think children under the age of 6-7 would get overwhelmed pretty quickly. I'm definitely glad I went\",\n",

It was very crowded & the ride waiting times were very long. The best part of the entire day was seeing the Electrical Light Parade!!! I saw it a lot as a kid growing up in Southern California and it was just as great! People started saving places to sit and watch 2 hours before the parade started. About ½ before it started a nice employee found us a place along Main Street. Squeeze in behind the ropes with other people. They\\'re suppose to collapse strollers if they do not have a child in it to make room for people. FYI: the parade starts at Its A Small World and ends at the end of Main Street. We ate dinner at the Plaza Inn on Main Street. They have the best fried chicken dinner (3 pieces plus mashed potatoes & gravy, green beans and a biscuit) for $17.49. The kid\\'s plate is $6.99 for a small fried chicken leg, mashed potatoes & gravy, apple sauce and a small drink. Disneyland implemented going thru security right when you get off the parking structure\\'s escalators. It made it much more efficient and saved time having it there than by the ticket booths. TIP: You can bring in bottled water so you don\\'t have to buy it in the park. TIP: If you burn easily, bring sunscreen with you!

Food and souvenirs are overpriced however, I was pleased that there was even Pandora and Sephora in the park to my surprise. I think my major issue in this park were the standby lines for the attractions. Some approximate waiting lines were as long as 145 minutes, 2 hours and 25 minutes! I was not willing to wait that long. I understand that it was necessary to wait, but this seems to take more time out of family fun and you spend more time waiting than enjoying yourself.To my personal displeasure there was no clubhouse in Mickey's Toontown. What a let down! Would it be Mickey's Toontown without his clubhouse? No, it wouldn't. I think I'll skip out on disneyland for my next time in California, but it was nice for my family and I for the most part.\",\n",

About 50% of these high end attractions were either closed for maintenance or some other reason.Walking over to Disneyland California Experience proper found exactly the same issue. Because of this the queues for the functioning rides are that much longer. Despite it being the \"quiet season\\' queuing for an hour for a ride was par for the course.The highlight was the evening parade , which occurs just before the park closes. However you need to stand around for about 90 minutes before to ensure you can see it and don\\'t get moved on from where you are standing.We were on a ride that broke down eating up about 45 minutes once you include the queuing in the first place. We got given a ticket that let us shorten the queue time on a single other ride, Not really a sufficient recompense. We had bought tickets for two days being able to move between both parks. On the second day we had had enough and left about lunch time. I\\'ve been to Disney Orlando back in 2011 and it was a fantastic experience. In comparison Anaheim , both Disneyland and the California Experience, were a huge disappointment. It\\'s not the friendly experience that Orlando is either with most of the staff looking very bored.

We have visited Disneyland almost every other year since we were children (and now have our own kids) and the service was always \"magical\", however, in this last visit, there seems to be an obvious change. Cast members were not as friendly or helpful. In fact at times, they were not friendly to the park goers... at lines for the rides, some cast members just wave people along without saying anything (not even a hello) or at the parade, cast members were yelling at guests to move (like, yelling in a rude manner). Maybe it was the heat?? We visited Disney World in Florida last year and the cast members there are still the authentic Disney-magic type who greet everyone with a smile and are helpful all around. Sad to see the original Disneyland may be losing its magic. Hopefully, this was a one off.

I have to say I was very disappointed with the experience. Everyone knows Disney isn't cheap but most people are ok paying because you know you're going to get a great experience, or so we thought. My first complaint would be the number of rides that were closed during our visit. Most people make plans for a trip to Disney months in advance but Disney will often release ride closures on very short notice. We knew about part of the park being closed while they work on Star Wars land and were ok with that. I assumed that meant that the other rides would be open. I was very disappointed to see just in the last couple weeks that in addition to the closures for Star Wars construction the Pirates of the Caribbean and Matterhorn Bobsleds would be closed as well. This was especially aggravating as these were the 2 rides that were different than Disney World that we wanted to experience. In addition to the ride closures we also experienced multiple unexpected temporary ride closures. We were in line 3 times where the ride broke down and they had to shut the rides down temporarily. Even the monorail was broken when we tried to ride that. The crowds were also a problem. We went during what was expected to be one of the slowest weeks of the year for the park and it was still quite crowded. Lines were often long for the attractions. I can't imagine coming here during peak season.Perhaps we were lucky on our previous trips to Disney World but we never experienced these problems before and again when you are paying Disney prices you expect a better quality. In the future we'll be sticking to the Florida parks.\",\n",

Big lines and waiting times are approx 30-60 mins atleast in every ride . Staff is not friendly nor helpful as waited with the baby for 20 mins in star wars lines only to get it know that babies are not allowed on this ride. Didnt you see the people with babies . Even in front of us has a 2 year old girl and they have to get out as well. If people think that staff service in disneyland if great than the have never seen one in other countries.

Found the stroller parks to be a major eye sore and obstacle throughout Disneyland - they need a better solution.Lastly... we saw Donald at Disneyland near the main gate then went to California Adventure and saw him there too in a different outfit... and only 5 minutes had past!

It was very hard not to be constantly comparing the park to the Magic Kingdom - some stretches were identical. But the experiences were completely different. While the castle is smaller, you can actually walk inside it and see Sleeping Beauty's story. The Finding Nemo ride has you get inside a submarine and travel through a lake of water. The outside of the It's a Small World ride is pretty neat to see! With a working clock, the building comes to life every 15 minutes. So definitely not Florida, but it has its own treasures.\",\n",

We spent a week dropping in to both parks and found it was not up to the standards the used to have. Not sure if this was a timing thing or a bad week but we frequently heard people say and saw the garbage cans overflowing. The were Disney personal standing around not in the spirit and crowds that seemed in managed. It seemed this trip it was about packing as many people in as possible and not about keeping a good experience.One example was rides maintenance. One day alone we were in Li e for four different rides that come down with no option for a fast pass or something after waiting an hour or more. Now I know Disney needs to make money but they used to be know for the best experience as well and I worried they are losing that.It is still an ok place to visit but it is not what it once was.

While this is part of the Disneyland experience it felt like the park wasn't ready for such a large influx of people as security lines were absolutely massive and rides kept on being shut-down.Hyper Space Mountain in particular was frustrating as it shut down several ties during the day, At one stage we had been waiting in line for 90min when the ride was shutdown and the cast members asked everyone to vacate. We couldn't get fastpasses for later as the days allotment was already exhausted by 1pm. We came back later and managed to get a ride after waiting another 2 hours.We were lucky with the other rides but I heard stories that other people wern't so lucky - and experienced similar issues as we did with Space Mountain,Other than these kinds of issues, the day was amazing and even with the waits the vibe of the park topped us getting too frustrated about it,\",\n",

Going in the \"off-season\" was definitely a good idea, because the lines for the rides were a lot shorter, and the fast passes definitely helped too.

Living in San Diego, my parents made sure Disneyland was an annual trek for our family - I remember the days of coupon books, and our station wagon glove box was full of partially used ticket books (all the A & B coupons - LOL!), and admission was around $5. You could go for the day and ride every single good ride multiple times. Once, we went on Space Mountain TEN TIMES! Nowadays, ticket prices are well in excess of $100 and you\\'re lucky if you make it onto 3 rides. In December, we waited in line for Thunder Mountain three times. After an hour of waiting, the ride broke down. This happened twice more. Same happened on Indiana Jones. I finally complained that we had been in the park for more than five hours and had only managed to get onto one \"good\" ride (Star Wars) and a supervisor gave us a \"front of the line\" ticket to any premium attraction. After the third breakdown on Thunder Mountain, we decided to just leave the park. We went on a total of three rides. They do have a \"Fast Track\", but you\\'re only allowed to use that for one attraction at a time. Seriously, Disneyland just needs to limit the number of admissions to ensure guests can at least get on some rides. Very disappointed. Only gave it two stars for the nostalgia of how great the park was when I was a child/teenager/young adult.',\n",

       " 'RIDES AND CHANGES:I am intensely disappointed that Disneyland has essentially turned Tomorrowland into Star Wars Land.I always loved Space Mountain but I was really really disappointed that it has been turned into a Star Wars ride. I also noticed that Captain Eo is gone. I understand that Disneyland wants to upgrade but there are some things that really should just get a refresher. What they really need to do a full overhaul on is the It\\'s a Small World ride. The upgrades to that ride actually make it more creepy and kind of offensive....oh and by the way, who ever heard of ADVERTISING a company like Siemens in a children\\'s ride?! Come on Disneyland, seriously?! I was also disappointed by the new way they do Fast Passes where I have to wait until after the end time of my current one to get another one; that really is inconvenient when some rides put you many hours out into the future by 10am (like Indiana Jones...we got FPs for that ride at 10:30am and it told us to come back at 3:15pm so we couldn\\'t get any additional FPs until after 4:15pm). The Indiana Jones ride, by the way, broke down right before the start window for our Fast Pass, so they let us come back later. And then the end climax of the ride didn\\'t work so we had to ride it again. I remember that ride always seeming to have a ton of problems.CLEANLINESS: Now all these complaints aside...I\\'ve never seen Disneyland look so clean. I haven\\'t been since 2010, but prior to that I went nearly every year and this place is looking good.I was very impressed with how clean they keep the park even when there\\'s tons of people everywhere. VERY IMPRESSED.DIAMOND CELEBRATION PHOTOS:We also were there during the Diamond Celebration and we were able to get our photos taken on a photo pass at a whole bunch of different places. Although, I do want to mention that they should have better explained this somehow because we missed a lot of opportunities to do this because we didn\\'t figure out how to identify the spots where you could get photos on a pay pass until the last few hours of our visit. Yes, it\\'s in the guide, but it would just have been awesome to have a more in-your-face explanation. And buying all the photos is super cheap so that would have been even more cool. You can download an entire day\\'s worth of photos for $39 so if you hit every spot on the map for a special photo, you\\'d get probably 100 photos. And you can do it in California Adventure, too. My favorite one was the one where they had us hold out our hands and then in the final photo, Tinkerbell is totally sitting in our hands. It was awesome. I am just really sad that we didn\\'t get to take full advantage of all of that.FOOD (Really important if you have food allergies or intolerances) AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS:The restaurants for sitdown eating in both parks serve really excellent food. At one place we had cranberry apple salads with candied walnuts and apple vinaigrette and it was to die for! And cheap. It is a small salad off the appetizer menu but it was filling because it was full of fiber and it was $6. And in any restaurant I\\'ve ever been in with something like that, that kind of salad at that size is usually $8 or more so I found it to be a great value. The waiter was also fabulously nice. And I forgot his name which makes me mad at myself because I would have loved to write to Disney and tell them how incredible he was.We\\'re talking Top 5 service encounters of my adult life. In fact, I\\'d really put him Top 3 alongside the waiters that always serve me at Ruth\\'s Chris Steakhouse. Also, the guy who sold me my frozen chocolate dipped banana was adorable and awesome.And that reminds me. Congratulations to Disney on getting with the healthy program. I was a tad concerned about eating options because I have some food intolerances. There were food stands EVERYWHERE in Disneyland where I could buy huge apples (individually bagged for sanitation!), fruit cups, hummus cups, vegetable trays, even pineapple spears! And they even had Vitamin Water and Vitamin Water Zero. You pay a premium ($2 for an apple) but it was totally worth it because I realize that less people are taking those healthy options and the fact that they made this available to me was really important. We originally thought we\\'d have to leave the park during the day to eat or pack in a bunch of food and I brought a ton of medication to deal with my intolerances and then not having to deal with all of that was just soooo incredible and was a big stress relief.It was overcast nearly the entire time we were there and I feel that we never waited longer than about 30 minutes for a ride (Space Mountain was maybe 45 minutes but we were in line with a bunch of other people before the ride even opened for the day). Disneyland also seems a much happier place to work because my past trips have always had at least one bad encounter with an employee who clearly hated their job, but everyone I talked to was so nice. We stopped in the tavern in Fantasyland for dinner one night and the girl who runs and ushers the line was just so friendly, and there was another employee off shift in front of me in line who talked to me too the whole wait, too, and then the guy I talked to when I was waiting for my special order was also great. I want to point out again on the food front that everywhere I asked for a special order, the people were VERY NICE and very accommodating. I apologized for making it difficult and was told every time, \"You are not being difficult. You have a good intolerance and it is not a problem for us to accommodate that.\" And there was a pizza and pasta place in California Adventure where the manager came out and asked me if I would rather have my salad made in the back away from the possibility of cross-contamination, and when I said that was not a concern because a little bit of cheese wouldn\\'t kill me, he expressed that he didn\\'t want me to even have a little bit of discomfort. I am really surprised because we live in Utah and most places act like I\\'m cutting them off at the knees if I ask them to wrap a burger in lettuce instead of putting it on a bun or if I ask them to make my salad without cheese on top. These people were all amazing and it was really great to feel cared about.',\n",
       " \"Compared to Disney World, it's funny because it's all so short. I personally prefer Disney World, because World is less cramped and you can get around the parade mess. But I liked the New Orleans area and had a blast on Hyper Space Mountain.\",\n",
       " 'I had visited Disneyland many years ago when my husband and I were going to school in the summers for graduate degrees. I remembered how whimsical and magical it was. I enjoyed the revisit but it was quite crowded. My favorite restaurant is the Blue Bayou - it is worth a visit and the tab.',\n",
       " 'Been going to Disneyland since I was a little kid. Every year the ticket prices go up and the lines get longer. This time we were so shocked at how many rides kept going out of service all weekend. We paid over $700.00 for tickets for two adults and two kids for 2 days. After paying for parking and food and a few shirts I\\'m sure it cost me at least 1000.00 bucks. So many people were in the park it was hard to even walk around. Long lines for food, rides and bathrooms. Fast passes ran out quick and were not available. We spent so much time walking around trying to get on rides that were either out of service when we got there or went out of service while we were in line. Indiana jones, haunted mansion, Astro boasters, space mountain, cars, scream and big thunder railroad are just some of the rides that had technical problems and were closed off and on. Just not fun to stand in line for 40 min to have them announce \"Sorry we are having technical problems and the ride is temporarily closed\". No other information is given. Could be closed 5 min or 5 hours. I have never experienced this in all the years of going to Disneyland. I remember thinking as we were waiting for over 2 hours in line for the cars ride how we must all be brain washed to pay 700.00 to stand in lines all day and think it\\'s somehow fun. Don\\'t think we will return until they limit the number of people that are let in the park each day. Just not worth the price they are charging anymore.',\n",
       " 'This is a classic, what can I say? It never gets old. The new Star Wars themed rides were excellent, there were quite a few attractions that were down for repairs but we went in slow season & we new this. The cost of the parks have gone up but we knew that too. Still will return whenever we can.',\n",
       " \"I have been to Disneyland in over 30 years. It was changed. There were so many people there. We got there about 10am. I had to get a wheelchair to help me. I was was good. The wait wasn't as long. I finally went on Star Tours. It was fantastic and I loved it.\",\n",
       " \"Finally got my family to Disneyland. Really well presented park and spotlessly clean. Great rides and attractions but the wait for rides was huge. 2 hour wait for a 2 minute ride. I liked the park. Had a 5 day pass but no desire to return. Thought the rides at universal studio were heaps better. If you only have a day or two and can't decide what park to visit - go to universal studios\",\n",
       " \"A must do if in LA. Our favourite rides were in Tomorrow land, but this reflects our age. Loved Hyperspace Mountain - was long queues, so advise go get fast passes early. That said the 90min projected wait was just over 60,and it went fast cos we met some awesome people in the line. Also enjoyed Star Tours, but my group felt it could have been a bit longer. Apparently it used to be, but has changed. There were others aboard who I heard found the motion enough. Do the Matterhorn bobsleds, not as hair raising as California Screaming but a great ride(for those looking for something a tad tamer). Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is another exciting ride, we did it at night. Advise a fast pass if you can, this is the longest line we waited in. There's heaps for youngsters too. My only disappointment of the day was the Haunted Mansion. There was a breakdown and we sat for a while inside which was not a problem, but I felt the ride , ghosts etc were very tired and needs updating. The fireworks display was spectacular with a snow flurry drop on us at the end. A perfect way to end a holiday.\",\n",
       " 'This was a mother/daughter trip and our first visit to Disneyland. We’ve been to Disney World numerous times.We were in the park the last week in April. A variety of Disneyland travel “experts” predicted low crowd levels. They couldn’t have been more wrong. The crowd levels ended up being 8s, 9s, and 10s. Even the weekdays were unbearable. If I had known the parks were going to be that busy we wouldn’t have gone. The result was long lines for everything including food and restrooms. And, in addition to all the scheduled closures due to the construction of Star Wars Land, the unexpected ride closures just made everything worse. Pirates of the Caribbean and India Jones were down repeatedly. We waited in line for Autotopia for 45 minutes and it went down when we were next to ride. A cast member gave us a FP for Autotopia and Big Thunder Mountain for our troubles, which was greatly appreciated, but it was still an hour wasted when all was said and done. On our last day Indiana Jones was down for hours. Given the crowd levels, it also seemed they didn’t have enough help working at the restaurants. It took more than 40 minutes just to order at Bengal Barbeque.The fireworks were cancelled at the last minute every night due to high altitude winds. Extremely disappointing since this was probably our only trip to Disneyland. Plus, we saw people staking out spots for the nightly parade and fireworks 4-5 hours in advance – INSANITY!!! We did not join in that insanity. One night we chose a spot near It’s a Small World to watch the parade and just as the parade started the adults in front of us allowed their children to stand on the decorative wrought iron fencing on top of the retaining wall. I’m sure these are the same people who would sue when their child gets hurt. They ruined the view for everyone behind them. Unfortunately, a cast member never came by to tell the people to get down and they refused to listen to any other guests, so that resulted in others standing on the retaining wall to get a better view. The park definitely seemed understaffed.I tried using the Disneyland app to search for food and get wait times, but the wait times were not very accurate. In general, we waited an average of 60 minutes for a ride. However, our last day was so crowded we only managed to do three rides in 6 hours. We simply gave up and left the park.I found it hard to get around the park because there were so many people. We were constantly being run into by strollers and scooters. We experienced people cutting in line, being pushy and just being selfish and rude. We had to adjust our expectations based on the unexpected crowd levels. We were not able to do everything we hoped, but we tried to make the best of it. We still had lots of fun. You just need to pack lots of patience and manage your expectations accordingly.BEWARE: There were long lines for the restrooms and even to wash your hands. We observed MANY people skip washing their hands after using the facilities. Wash your hands frequently, keep your hands away from your face, and use hand sanitizer. Yuck!',\n",
       " \"This was our first trip to Disneyland & I have to say I was a little disappointment on how small the park is & the castle compared to Disney World castle. The kids had fun on some of the rides, but long lines & lot of people made it hard to enough our time there. What I don't like is that you have to wait hour in line to see a Disney or super hero character. Not what I remember growing up from Disney world when the characters would be walking around the park, taking pictures with you & signing auto graphs. Now you have to wait in long lines & if you don't get there early enough you miss the characters. The frozen characters (the one's the kids really want to see) you have to get there when the park first opens to get a ticket, if not then you miss your chances. The long lines, missing characters, price on things made the day not as special as I would've hoped. I can't believe too how expensive one day ticket is (I was lucky my dad gets a discount w/ his company.\",\n",
       " 'My daughter, 35 years old, talked us into going on this weekend trip. Two days at Disney and a day at another theme park kind of wiped us out. That being said, we had a great time. On Friday the park was crowded. On Saturday there was a mob. If you can swing it go on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday unless it\\'s a holiday. The crowds are smaller and the lines are shorter. I would recommend you get there as early as possible. They open at 8 AM in the summer. Hustle your buns to your favorite ride (Hyper-Space Mountain) get in line to ride it. When it\\'s done ride it again if the line is less than half an hour long. After the second time get a fast-pass and then explore the rest of the park. You can only have one fast pass at a time for Disneyland. Go to see the rest of the park until your fast-pass time then use it and get another when you would would like to go again. A little planning will go a long way once you get into the park. There are apps for smart phones that you can get that will give you wait times for the \"rides\" in the park. Do take in the shows as well. They are very entertaining and give you a chance to get off your feet for a while.Food and drinks are quite expensive in the park. Bring your own water bottle and fill it up at drinking fountains in the park. Restaurants are busiest at meal time so eat lunch at 2 PM instead of noon and you will have a shorter line. Eat dinner at 8 instead of 6. Lunch and dinner for a family of four including drinks will be about $80 for each meal. The portions are large so consider one meal for the kids to share if they will do that. You can take your own food into the park but remember you have to carry it until you consume it. Be sure not to use any mayonnaise or salad dressing in your food if you bring your own.Two day admissions are a good value. If you have a family of four, admission, parking, meals, and souvenirs for a day can easily be $1000. Usually you can go between Disneyland and California Adventures on the same admission. If you leave the park be sure to hang onto your ticket and get stamped on the way out. There are different attractions in the two parks so it\\'s worth while to go to both.I am a roller coaster nut and there are three in the two parks. There is Hyper-Space Mountain which is an excellent ride. Be sure to listen to the music and commentary on the ride. Thunder Mountain Railroad is fun but tamer. California Screamin\\' in California Adventures is a good outside coaster. Not the wildest I\\'ve been on but very nice. Tower of Terror in CA Adventures is also great. I would say all of the rides are appropriate for children that meet the height requirements.If you can go on a day that is raining most of the attractions will still be open and the lines will be very short and you won\\'t have to go on water rides to get wet. If is raining take an umbrella.We had a great time. Hope you will too.',\n",

       " \"Beeing in Disneyland is like being in a Disney cartoon.Everything is made down to the last detail, and that goes for the rides too.We came on a Wednesday, which made it less crowded (still a lot of people compared to Danish standards)Expect 20-30 min of waiting in most lines. It can seem like a long time, but they handle quest very well, and make sure you are also entertained even while waiting in line.After Disney bought Star Wars, several rides have star wars themes, which is not a bad thing if you're a fan. We spend the full day (13 hours)Entre is 95$\",\n",
       " 'This was our first time visiting Disneyland, we usually go to Disney World. It was awesome! Smaller than DW, DL was more doable with just a few days to visit. They have many of the same attractions as DW, and some have a different twist. Biggest tip-if you have children who love Star Wars like mine, get to the park a half hour early, be at the opening, and run towards Tomorrowland to get on line for the Jedi Training. It closes out very fast! Our kids LOVED this! Best part of the whole thing. California Adventure has the actual Lightning McQueen, Red, and Mater, who drive in and pose for pictures like real characters. My 5 year old went bananas for that.',\n",
       " \"This is our fourth visit and it still has the magic! They do their best to keep queues down but sometimes there are just to many people. The fast pass system helped a lot with stopping us from getting a bit frustrated. If you go with the understanding you will have to wait for rides and spend a lot of money then you won't get any surprises. Loved the finding memo submarine ride! Would highly recommend it for all the family!!\",\n",
       " \"My daughter and I headed to Disneyland for a short, last-minute vacation. This was our third time at Disneyland (what can I say? we love it!) and it was as enjoyable as the last two visits. Maybe more so, in fact. May isn't peak time at Disneyland, especially around the Canadian long weekend. There are grad nights to contend with, so if hordes of unsupervised teenagers aren't your idea of fun, then stay away on grad nights. But I found they were mostly respectful and not a concern...just makes the lines a little longer. For the most part, the ride wait times weren't too long...actually some of the shortest we've seen before, in the 5-10 minute range, as opposed to the 60-minute range in the summer.Staff, as always, are friendly and helpful. You'll run into the odd grumpy, unhelpful cast member, but that happens everywhere and after dealing with crowds day after day after day, who can blame them?It's still the 60th celebration, which goes until September, so the fireworks and parades are all new and wonderful to celebrate.Would we go again? You bet!\",\n",
       " 'There is probably no time to visit this place and avoid the massively long lines except for tiny windows here and there. (ex: week after Thanksgiving..) However, I thought that since most of the schools in the US and Canada were still in session, that May would have been a good time to visit.I was WRONG...May is for graduates- high school, college, and middle school. We were overrun by the cap and gown crowds being bused in from all over California. There were also choirs, academic achievers, etc.. In fact, one group actually took over the Indiana Jones attraction and it was off limits to the general public. I don\\'t think that is fair, especially to people who come from thousands of miles and pay tons of money thinking they will get to see at least the most popular attractions.By booking all these large groups for May, I am sure Disney makes a profit. But, at what cost to the rest of us? Long lines (2 hours plus for \"Hyperspace Mountain!) combined with reduced hours ensure that, if you are lucky, you might make it to 5-6 rides. That is if you have a big bladder and don\\'t need to eat, drink, or rest. That means that each 2 minute ride is costing you about $20. Is it worth it? My kid loves Disneyland and seeing her delighted face is certainly worthwhile. But this place has become way too expensive. For a lot less you could go to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, buy the kids an all day, unlimited rides wrist brand, and you could sit on the beach and tan while they play. Sounds so much better than standing in endless lines for EVERYTHING at Disneyland, from rides to food to bathrooms. Those are chunks of your life you are never getting back.Plus, you\\'ll be walking...always walking. The gloriously underwhelming 60th anniversary has shut down the train, the monorail, boats, etc. To me, the whole 60th anniversary thing was over-hyped and poorly executed.Bottom line: Unless you are a huge Disney fanatic, or have kids that INSIST on Disneyland, save yourself a lot of time, hassle, and expense. If this is your once-in-a-lifetime trip to California, why not explore some of the other terrific places this state has to offer? Take the scenic route up the coast and visit some of the fantastic beaches, take surfing lessons, go to Yosemite, ride a cable car in San Francisco, lay on Pismo Beach and knock back a few beers...You will be less tired and less poor doing this than you will after visiting Disneyland/California Adventure.',\n",

We chose a weekend as it had extended hours for us to enjoy the fireworks and parades. It was pretty crowded as Dapper Days were happening that weekend.....very cool seeing how elaborately some people dressed. As excited as we all are about our visits to Disneyland we were a little disappointed with the 60th as opposed to the 50th anniversary. We were surprised with the amount of things that were closed down given all the hype and advertising for the 60th. Fantasmic is one of our favorites so we were wondering why that would be closed down during the 60th? We realize that it was because of construction, but the timing isn't the greatest. This probably wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but there were a lot of other things out of commission including the Monorail, Railroad, Matterhorn (only opened on weekends), and the Jungle Cruise was not open (although the reenactment was pretty funny). This seemed to be a lot of things down during a milestone celebration. We loved the new parade...it was spectacular and we loved the nod to the Electric Light Parade. Of course, we continue to be disappointed that Billy Hill no longer performs at the park. That was one of our big hi-lites each trip. We didn't even go into the Golden Horseshoe this vacation. While we always enjoy our visits, this one wasn't quite up to the standards we've experienced in the past due to all the closures. Perhaps the 60th shouldn't have been extended to 2016 if everything in both parks couldn't be opened.\",\n",

I would recommend getting there early and go right to Star Wars and get a speed pass for star tours, during our trip that ride had a wait time of 60 mins almost the whole day. we download the Disneyland App and they will take your pictures in the park and they are spend to your phone within 30 mins.

Disneyland Park keeps evolving, which is why some rides such as the Disneyland Railroad and Monorail were not operating at the time. However, an iconic ride that had not been operating on our two previous visits was – Autopia, which is one of the few original Disneyland rides still operating.The night parade is still amazing. Currently called Paint The Night, the lights, colour and creativity is brilliant.The Indiana Jones adventure is still my favourite ride and that has now been operating for 21 years. A more recent ride that is great fun is Buzz Lightyear and the Astro Blasters. The first ride on this was with my three year grandson and he had a great time shooting for points, scoring about a third more than I did. However, my score improved significantly with each ride.From my perspective, Disney is one of the best organisations in the world. They know exactly what their business is and generally they provide an experience, not just a series of rides or a performance.Although we had intended this Disneyland trip as a once-in-a-lifetime experience with all the family, my wife is already planning for everyone to go again in a few years’ time.',\n",

It helps you find characters, shows line times, where washrooms are...everything! We used it non-stop!Tip 2: But the photopass! The park has professional photographers sprinkled all over. Want a picture of your family with the castle behind you? You can have it! Ask your photographer for the card and then keep that card and pass it to the next photographer and they scan it. There is a small fee but you get access to beautiful high-end photos with characters, on all the rides and scenic locations. I brought my nice camera but still appreciated having these photos!3. FAST PASSES! Do it. When you walk through the gate (preferably morning) go straight to ride that offers fast passes that you know you want to ride(your app will tell you which ones offer them!) Grab a Fast pass for that ride then go on some other rides as the wait lines drastically increase hour by hour. You can only get one at a time BUT, it will say return between 10 and 11am, so at 10am you can get another fast pass. Just do this and save yourself some time!4. Mornings with Children! Always go right at gate opening! Its the only way with kids.5. Bring autograph books for the kids and permanent markers, all the characters will sign books and disney character stuffed toys!6. 3 days is needed. Day one, start in Frontierland/Adventure land rides. Day two rides and toontown, Day three, blitze all the characters and get autographs!7. Jedi Knight training for kids ages 4-12 is the cutest thing in the world. You have to sign your kids up first thing in the morning. If you show up on a magic morning day, they start registration right at 8am so get to the launch bay right away!8. There\\'s a starbucks!!!! Holy frick, I lost my mind when I discovered I could stay caffeinated! (Its on the main street and there is no outdoor advertising other than \"coffee\" outside)9. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays are \"Magic Mornings\" for those who carry a three day or more pass purchased online. I thought it would be \"quieter\" but it was actually busier in my opinion. It may have been that it was a Thursday when we used it but Tuesday was hands down the quietest day we experienced.10. Gotta hand it to Disney for phenomenal marketing and the way they cater to families. Every \"Cast Member\" was exceptional and incredibly friendly. Wonderful trip!',\n",
       " 'We\\'ve been to Disney multiple times and wanted to see the special events for the 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration. Even though the anniversary was technically 2015, they have extended the special parades/fireworks through the fall. We visited in mid-May hoping it would be a little less crowded, but I\\'m not sure you experience Disneyland without crowds unless you go when it is raining. There were LOTS of people in the park - season pass holders had no restrictions for the time period we were visiting, so perhaps there were a lot of locals there. We visited three days from Sunday to Tuesday. Sunday was the most crowded, but also had the most going on in terms of parades and shows. We were able to see the Soundsational parade in the afternoon and the new Paint the Night Parade in the evening. We did the Aladdin Oasis dinner package so we could get seating in a reserved viewing area across from It\\'s a Small World. The food was not impressive, but we were able to eat our boxed meal at Aladdin\\'s Oasis, which was truly an oasis away from all the crowds. The area reserved for viewing was good, but arrive a little earlier than 30 minutes before the show. We came at that time and most of the areas up front were already filled with people with strollers. You can also stay in this area to view the fireworks and see the show projected on the front of It\\'s a Small World. The Paint the Night Parade is really exceptional. The floats are marvels of engineering and special effects and the dancers that accompany the big floats have wonderful costuming. It was worth our visit just to see the parade and we made sure to see it each night. The fireworks show is also very good and very nostalgic, featuring Tinkerbell, Winnie the Pooh, and other favorites. The park is decorated with special anniversary banners and the castle is transformed into a sparkling silver blue masterpiece. Be sure to get your photo taken in front of the castle. Also, if you want to see the Mickey and the Map live show, be aware that it may not be available during all weekdays or there may be fewer performance times. There are special mouse ears for the anniversary and my girls wanted to get them to match the golden ears they got at the 50th anniversary. On this trip we also enjoyed the Disney Band that performs on main street and at the flag retreat. The day we watched the flag retreat they asked members of all the branches of the service to come forward when the band played their anthem. It was exceptionally moving. If you have Star Wars fans, Tomorrowland has been given a makeover with special Star Wars meals available, a quick movie synopsis of the films, and most importantly, a re-envisioning of Space Mountain to include Star Wars music and visuals. It was a nice addition to the park while the new Star Wars area is being built. Now for the not so good news: The train is not running around the park during construction, so if you are used to using the train to take a break from fighting the crowds while getting to another \"Land,\" then you will have to get used to slowly milling with the throngs of people as you cross the park. In addition, the passway from Fantasy Land to Big Thunder Mountain is also closed, funneling even more people through the center of the park. When we visited, crowds were not at full volume, but it was still a challenge. If you have the option of doing a Magic Morning, grab it, because you can visit a lot of rides, especially in Fantasy Land before the park begins to fill. But I wouldn\\'t waste your hour of time on Peter Pan\\'s Flight unless you happen to be one of the first few people in line for the Magic Morning. We found everyone made a beeline to Peter Pan\\'s flight and the line quickly swelled to a 45 minute wait. We decided to go visit other rides and quickly rode about 6 attractions and then came back to Peter Pan where the line was actually a bit shorter. The line tends to stay about 45 minutes all day long, so just accept the wait as part of your day. Although I will say that weather in Anaheim tends to have cloudy mornings and sunny afternoons. There is no shade in the queue area for Peter Pan, so doing the ride in the morning when there is cloud cover will be more comfortable. Obviously, try to make use of the Fast Pass system (it\\'s more efficient to send one member of your group with all the tickets to get the passes than dragging everyone around the park) but flexibility is also important. We happened upon the Flag Retreat Ceremony and also a live Mary Poppins performance in front of the castle and these spontaneous moments were some of the best memories from the trip.',\n",

       " \"This was my first time going here and I wasn't disappointed at all! I had two day hopper tickets and stayed at a good neighbor hotel. I would recommended getting there before they open! We enjoyed the experience a lot better and got in five rides before noon when the crowds started getting to much for us. The next day we got there the same time and got pictures with characters about five until we gave up and did the rides. The characters were randomly all over the park and the lines were a lot shorter then expected. I defiantly recommend getting there early (crowds start pouring in around noon), plan ahead (read up on the website, buy tickets for both parking and the park before you go)and I'm sure you will have a magical experience !!! Most stop st The World of Disney for all your souvenirs :)\",\n",

       " \"I've always loved Disneyland, having visited the California park twice as a child and the Orlando resort twice in the last 4 years, on a recent trip to LA I thought I would re-visit the original Disney. Big mistake and an even bigger waste of money.Once through the gates it becomes very difficult to negotiate your way around the park as you are met by a sea of people, push chairs and scooters. Queuing times for all rides were in excess of an hr and this was mid week out of peak season. After 7 hrs in the park we only managed to get on 4 rides which was quite annoying given that we'd paid $135 for a ticket.When the parade began things got worse as a melee of people gathered to watch it and a stampede began during which I witnessed people and bollards being knocked over several times. There was little crowd control and it was quite apparent that too many people were in the park.If you want the Disney experience visit Orlando. Disney California is a waste of time and money, greed has removed all enjoyment. You will queue excessively for rides, queue for ice cream and even queue for the toilet. Not a pleasant way to spend the day.\",\n",
       " \"Magical! I've been to Disney World more times than I can remember, but hadn't been to Disneyland since I was 13. It was well worth another visit, especially with the Disneyland Forever theme going on. The fireworks made me tear up with the Walt nostalgia. Paint the Night Parade was a bit of a Main Street Electrical Parade throwback but with it's on uniqueness. And the park itself was so fun. Some classic rides and some you can only do in Disneyland (Toad's Wild Ride/Matterhorn) - and even the ones you can also see in Disney World just might have some subtle differences that makes doing the attraction a must. We look forward to going back and see what else changes and what stays the same!\",\n",
       " \"The best thing i can recommend is to visit during a weekday. You don't want to spend all your hard earned money on a one-day ticket, just to spend most of the day waiting in line for your favorite rides. I suggest picking a weekday if your'e visiting the area, to avoid the large weekend crowds.This is also true for holidays, you can forget about christmas....The crowds are horrendous. If you're lucky, and there's a little rain, that will also keep the crowds at bay. Do some research, and see if your favorite rides or attractions will be available to get the most out of your trip.All that being said, I am a passholder and have been for many years. My friends and I always have a great time at Disney. There is so much see and do, and the fireworks show is a must. If you plan it out right, you will not be dissapointed.\",\n",
       " 'I have been to this park multiple times as a child and as an adult. My spouse and I go every 5-10 years to either here or Disney World. It brings back the kid in me! I go around with a silly happy grin. Sure there are too many people there at times making lines super long, but go mid-week, not during the summer or any vacation/holidays, go early in the day, use a Fast Pass when available, and go into the single rider line for really long waits. The stuff going on around, movies, character meets, exhibits, shows, etc, all add to the attraction that Disney holds. This is a multi-day park, as the rides and the spaces where you stand in line all have something fun to read or look at. We usually go for 2-3 days with a Park hopper, go one day to California Adventures with a visit in the evening for fireworks and other shows, then 2 days in Disneyland Park. We did notice this time that there were some cast members who didn\\'t seem as thrilled to be there as they normally look. A few were in a hurry to get to their break so when we asked a cast member probably on his way to his lunch, he sort of answered as he continued walking, and there were some with less than happy faces, but at other times we ran into sweepers who would chat with us about some show or event we ought to go to or a ride that had a hidden interesting object. Overall we thot the staff was ok, just not as \"happy\" as some of our past visits.Also, during less popular times, some rides are shut for maintenance. Unfortunately, Pirates of the Caribbean and its restaurant were closed during our visit, but some of the others, like the Matterhorn that was said to be closed actually opened while we were there',\n",
       " 'Just had our first trip to DLR and it is better than Magic Kingdom in my opinion. Ride against ride it wins almost every time. The only issue is the crowds, wow it was crazy busy.',\n",
       " 'Great experience for kids and adults. Lots to do and lots of shopping or food available too. For increased riding by adults, try the single rider option on Indiana Jones and the Matterhorn. Best food deal was the mangos and grapes sold at stand in Frontier Land or on Main Street. The fruit was really fresh and sweet.',\n",
       " \"There is a fair amount of refurbishing going on to get ready for the summer season but if anything it was an advantage because the crowds were smaller.

       " 'We love taking an adults Disney trip every few years! Here are a few tips and our favorite things to do if you\\'re going as adults and in a small group:-Get to the park at opening. Yes, there will be families there at the same time, but in my experience they head toward Fantasyland or stop for breakfast, etc. Hit the busiest rides first, before they get too crowded...Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Indiana Jones, etc. -Utilize \"single rider\" passes! Many rides offer these. You\\'ll still get to hang out together during the line, and you most likely will not sit together, but it is a good way to ride the popular attractions without wasting hours in line. There are times we have ended up seated in the same vehicle. We use this option for Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Radiator Springs Racers, California Screamin, etc. -Get Fast Passes for the rides you can\\'t do Single Rider (or don\\'t want to separate on)...Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Tower of Terror...-Blue Bayou is a fun option for lunch or dinner',\n",

It was good, but you need to do your homework.We only had 1 day so decided to do the original park. Maybe a mistake with the age of our children but still had fun (and they dont love scary rides).Thinks to do -1. Get their early (we drove from downtown (weho)and drive was okay (against most traffic)2. Use the fast past ticket line system (have a good read of how it works)3. Go in a clock wise direction (after getting fast pass for the busy rides)4. Try to go mid week, non holidays in winter5. Talk your kids out of waiting in line for the matterhorn (2 hour wait the day we were there with no fastpass)6. Remember were you parked your car (the carparks are huge)7. Have fun & takes lots of cash',\n",

In short we had fun!The coolest thing was we went on May 4, but chance, not plan. The park was a full of star wars , and when we went on Space Mountain our minds were blown as they changed the ride to Hyper Space mountain!!!!! This is the coolest upgrade I have seen! if you haven't been on this ride in a while you must go!\",\n",

I was amazed to see my daughter\\'s face when she was looking at fantacyland castle , characters dancing in parade ....I hope to come back there. You should plan your trip properly , reach there by 9:30 AM at least to see different characters at the main street (main entrance) .... It is advisable to complete fantacyland first as those become crowded later & those closes first too....\"It\\'s Small world\" is mast if you are taking your children. You can target to go there by 2:30 so that you finish that up by 3:30 pm. After that you take some place in the same street to see the parade which starts from Main street (entrance) at 4:30 PM. Don\\'t forget to take mat to sit on the street. You can enjoy different rides there after that.Later half you can target adventure park & other area & walk towards main street for Mickey\\'s soundasation Parade starts at 8:30 /8:45 PM. Again its best you reserve some place on the street earlier to best enjoy the show. Later you can stay there for firework, Unfortunately on 14th , due to weather, it was cancelled which something you need to be ready too :(.Please carry the following - cap, sun glass, sunscreen, Mat, lots of water. Don\\'t get trolley bag because trolley bags are not allowed.jackets/sweaters (as sometime its very windy, your children might feel cold).Overall, its really great place to visit.',\n",

Keep your eyes open and you will find places to walk that are less crowded at times. Last two hours and first two hours are obviously the least crowded. We could list 100 tips but the biggest thing is just enjoy. Do what your KIDS want to do. Make sure they have fun.\",\n",
       " \"Wow not sure when Disneyland became so overcrowded during the week, but during this visit the crowds were excruciating! The lines were long and while fast pass was an improvement it also led to more walking. As older folks traveling without kids it was bad enough, but couldn't imagine if you had a toddler. Glad we broke up our 3 day Disneyland visit with a trip to Universal Studios where the crowds were much lighter and the lines short. Still have to love Disneyland and when the grandchild is old enough will be back for more!\",\n",

Sadly I was disappointed; Disney California lacks the Disney magic and doesn't have the same vibe. The park felt claustrophobic and vastly over crowded due to the sheer number of people that were pouring through the gates all day long. It was difficult to walk from one area to the next as thousands of people swarmed around. After 5 hrs we only managed to go on 3 rides owing to the 1.5 hr long queues, there was a 30 minute queue for ice cream, a 30 minute queue for coffee and a 15 minute queue to use the filthy restrooms. This is far from Walt Disney's vision.\",\n",

I was re-living all my childhood television dreams. Star Wars was fantastic but I am a fan. Everything else I loved. We had 3 day passes but I think I would have liked longer. Loved the parade, loved watching the kids faces. Just the best place to go and the highlight of our USA trip',\n",
       " 'It continues to evolve and grow, within its boundaries. The new Star Wars exhibition in Tomorrowland is brilliant. A display of props and videos of behind the scenes. They have interactive games. We had a brilliant time just a shame our favourite ride Pirates of the Caribbean was closed again for the length of our stay, it was closed when we visited 2 years ago. There are a great choice of fast and slow rides, a great choice of food and drink available throughout.',\n",
       " \"If you go to Disneyland get the 3 day park hopper. There is just too much to do in both parks and you really need 3 days to do it all. Bring extra money for food because the food is amazing and you need to try it. Learn to use fast passes and be smart about them. Aside from Peter Pan you should never have to wait more than 30 minutes if you use your fast passes right. It's a great place and time flys by when you're there!\",\n",
       " 'We arrived on a Monday and found it quite busy but by using our fast pass we were able to get on most of the rides that we wanted to visit. The ship and paddle wheel river boats and other things on the water were out of service. The weather was actually pleasant during the visit but we needed a jacket in the evenings to stay warm. We made use of the lockers for $7.00 (small lockers) to keep our jackets, snacks and a few water drinks. All food within the park is expensive as one might think. We did eat at the Mexican food place (sorry forgot the name) by the indoor shooting range and found that to be good. The parade in the evening was wonderful as was the fireworks. One is normally tired by the time the parade comes along but waiting for the parade and the fireworks is worth it in my opinion. Wonderful. The hardest part is finding a place to watch the parade since people line up some time ahead. One of the friendly park staff helped us find a place where we could stand and watch.',\n",
       " \"Disneyland is great, so great in fact that it's become ridiculously overcrowded during peak days. It's essential the plan your visit ahead of time in order to maximize time spent having fun and minimize time spent standing in lines. Download the Disneyland app (iOS or Android) to help you manage your time efficiently, plus important things like food and restrooms. Don't lug around a big bag of junk, rent a locker and retrieve stuff as needed. They even offer lockers with built-in phone chargers! Check the events schedule so you can watch the parades & shows that interest you and avoid the pedestrian gridlock of the ones that don't. Bring bottled water and maybe some single-serve drink mixes, the restaurants will let you refill from the drink fountains. Most importantly, DON'T BRING BABIES OR TODDLERS!! They cost you a ticket, pushing a stroller through crowds will make you miserable, and the kids won't remember anything anyway.Attractions are constantly being updated, so this ain't your dad's Matterhorn. Space Mountain, Star Tours, Indiana Jones Adventure and Big Thunder Mountain have all been recently refreshed.Disney is also aggressively re-theming to Star Wars, and to a lesser extent Marvel, so expect to see characters like Chewbacca and Iron Man wandering around next to Ariel and Cinderella. As part of the new Star Wars Land construction, the railroad and everything associated with Rivers of America (Mark Twain riverboat, Fantasmic show, Tom Sawyer island etc) are shut down until construction is complete.In short, prioritize the activities that are most important (rides or parade?, sit down to eat or grab 'n' go and eat while you wait?), and plan as much of your visit around those. Be prepared for miles of walking, carry only what you need, leave the little kids at home, and most of all have fun.\",\n",

       " 'PATIENCE……… We visited Disneyland on 05/18. It was crowded with many high school “senior day” kids. In fact, one of the parking lots was closed just for those busses to park. I would recommend not visiting during mid-May to late June. This is the graduation season and many visitors are in the park. Upon arrival, you will find that parking is $18 for cars and motorcycles (unless you have an annual pass that includes parking). After parking you will catch a tram to the entrance plaza of Disneyland / California Adventure and will go through a cursory security screening. A word of advice SELFIE STICKS ARE PROHIBITED within the park. After passing through security, you proceed to the entrance kiosk and enter Disneyland. Upon entering, you are on Main Street, USA, and gateway to the lands of imagination of Walt Disney. From here in a clockwise direction is Adventure land, New Orleans Square, Critter Country. Frontier land, Fantasyland, Mickey’s Toontown and Tomorrow land. Check the website for attractions that are closed for renovation. Even being packed people are moved orderly and quickly. Utilize the fast passes that are available. Tips: be prepared for a lot of walking and standing Start early, pace yourself and end late. Exit the park to eat, much cheaper (Bring your own water and snacks) Use the FASTPASS for those rides you really want to go on but do not want to wait in a long line. If you want to eat at the BLUE BAYOU – call ahead for reservations.  Stay and watch the parade and fireworks show. Watch out for strollers, they are notorious heel biters.  MOST IMPORTANT THOUGH – ENJOY YOURSELF. See it though the eyes of a child. IT IS A MOST MAGICAL PLACE.',\n",

An acquaintance on the same trip with us joined us for the day and we were all really impressed and totally enjoyed the day. The cost is very reasonable, the level of detail put in to every aspect of the park is incredible. The rides are worth the wait, comprehensively represent the stories they are based on and are enjoyable and educative. Service is great everywhere. After we left we noted that we hadn't seen anyone smoke or drink alcohol at all during the day. While there were masses of people there we also didn't see any rudeness, pushing in queues, arguing, or even any unhappy children. With so many kids there you would expect some tantrums but it genuinely was like we'd walked under some pixie dust at the entry as all we saw was happiness all day. Despite some long waits for some rides, they have signs with wait times and we learnt the wait was less than the signs said. Also the waits are moving through castles and buildings that are part of the ride and story experience so it mostly isn't like a wait as you take in the building story and artefacts. We initially weren't going on the Nemo ride as we thought it was for young kids, but later the line was short so did, and all three of us considered it a highlight. The parade and fireworks blew my mind, amazing, and to think they do it every single night. We were staying at the opposite end of LA and people told us it would be hard and expensive to get there - wrong! We got an Uber, it cost about $40 US, when we left a car was there so no wait and the cost was about $45US - money well spent and the trip was less than an hour. There are an extensive range of souvenir shops with quality products at decent prices. Budget for this! Plan for a big day & stay till the end to enjoy the parade and light show. The rides get quieter after about 430. Buy some mouse ears and wear them with pride amongst the masses. I loved Mickey's house and you are able to get photos with your own camera or phone taken by Disney staff. Some days are cheaper. We went on a Monday, quiet day & cheaper $95 entry. Enjoy!\",\n",

When you walk in, you’ll see Sleeping beauty’s castle and Tomorrow Land on it’s right side. We went to Tomorrow Land first to try the STAR TOUR ride and it was really cool. I really enjoyed that! After we finished the ride, it was ALREADY JAMMED PACK BUSY. It got a little claustrophobic; but still fun.Then we tried walked to Sleeping Beauty’s castle and took pictures. The gentleman who took our pictures was really friendly and nice. Then we wanted to try the Snow White Ride; at first line up was moving but everything shut downed for 5 minutes and station were running again. After 10 minutes, power went out again and we were told that we have to wait another 10-15 more minutes so we just walked out. No big deal, things like that happen and people are still happy. After that, we just tried the carousel. LOL (we were lame because we were in time sensitive case and we didn’t really take full advantage of the park hopper). Our last ride was “it’s a small world” and that was very relaxing and calm; then when we got out we were on time for the Disney Parade of Mickey and Friends. I also cried watching that parade but I was so overwhelmed buy HOW HAPPY AND ENERGIZED the crowd was. After the parade we walked around and found some souvenir shops and went to Starbucks at Downtown Disneyland. We left the park at 7:30.

Create a plan of action and use fastpass where possible! The crowd calendars on all the Disney blogs/websites are way off this year! Paint the Night parade is a must see but find a spot early (like 90 mins early!) We had an obstructed view (sat outside Carnation Cafe) but could manage to see most of it and it's incredible! The staff here is not typical Disney employees. We found the employees in Florida and CA Adventure way friendlier! I know this park is going through alot so maybe moral is down. The fireworks were cancelled the night we were in the park due to high winds, if windy, you will see a white balloon being launched and that means they are testing the winds in the atmosphere.

For all five days we were there the train was down out of service but you could take a picture? Whoo hoo! This was dosappointing for 2 reasons. One the kids love trains and that was something they were looking forward to doing, and two its a lkng walk to het the kids around the park to all the areas when they are that young. During 2 different days at the park we went to ride the indian jones ride whicb left us waiting in line for hours because it broke down, and there were many parts of the ride that were not working when we did finally get to ride it. These are just a few things that were disappointing about the park. There were other rides out of comission. Lines that lasted for over an hour and a half. These wait times are to be expected, but there were even half hour wait times for the fastpass lines. And then not being able to get more than 2 fast passes on your ticket is a great fault. We could have gotten 5 fast passes for rides and made everyone of them with a shorter time but were not allowed more than 2. Just overall a bad crummy experience.  Unless myself or my family ever won a free vacation there, We will not be back.',\n",

If you are here this year, highly recommend to watch the \"Paint the Night\" parade. The parade song still stuck in my brain two weeks after my visit! The parades were wonderful and magical!I especially commend the staff in Disneyland Park for their dedication and help throughout my visit.

Lines that long just take the fun out of it !We watched the Paint the Night Parade and loved it, they did a beautiful job of it and the people that created it are amazing but what happened afterwards was terrible.We tried to get out of the park and ended up being heard like cattle with 1000's of other people. It was dangerous. We had to carry our son because it was too dangerous to allow him to walk.If some emergency had of happened, nothing would have been able to done because of how crazy the crowds are.

You can check online before you go to see if major rides are scheduled to be down for an extended period of time. We are moving into summer, and the park is going to get crowded, so purchase your tickets ahead of time to skip that part of the line, be there when the park opens, take a break at your hotel during the hot/crowded part of the day, and return to close the park in the evening. If you can handle missing the parade, the crowd is drawn to the parade, so that\\'s a great time to be in Adventure or Frontier Land. There is a nice view of the fireworks from near Splash Mountain, and it\\'s not crowded. Avoid Tomorrow Land at parade time. Walking through there is difficult due to crowds.

We also experienced extremely long lines when entering the park from the Downtown Disney side.

       " \"We just returned for a trip to Disneyland last night. It was our first trip in about 5 years.My girls and I used to have annual passes for about 5-6 years in a row, and we would frequent Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure (DCA) often. We stopped renewing our annual passes because we had so much of Disney were content to take a break so we could enjoy other things. Now after years of absence we are back with an annual pass. Annual passes are convenient for us since we only live 118 miles north of the Disneyland Resort. We were there for 3 days from 5/9/16 - 5/11/16. We rode almost every ride in both parks. There were several new rides in DCA since our last visit when the Ariel ride was under construction. Other additions include Cars Land, and the World of Color show. Cars Land is super cute and fun, with detail that can only come to life from Disney. In fact Radiator Springs Racers is now in a tie with Toy Story Mania as being our favorite ride(s) in DCA. World of Color is a pure Disney Magic show that is worth the time. I would recommend using magic morning hour in DCA for the Radiator Springs Racers since the line is consistently long all day.Not much has changed in Disneyland park with the exception of Tomorrowland practically being turned into a Star Wars attraction. Since I'm a fan of Star Wars, I'm cool with the changes. My 13 year old daughter isn't a fan of star wars, but still liked the attractions, so even people who aren't huge star wars fans still enjoy themselves.The only negative things I experienced on the trip were that both the Disneyland Monorail and the Disneyland Railroad are closed for refurbishment at the same time.This is a huge concern, especially if anyone in your party has a disability or mobility issue. Both the monorail and train are used for transportation to/from and around the park, so with both being closed at the same time a visit to the park now requires much, much more walking than normal. If you use and/or rely on the monorail for transportation due to a disability, you might not want to visit Disneyland until both are up and running again because you will be walking a lot more than normal.All the extra walking made not only my feet hurt, but a bone tumor I have in the distal fibula in my left leg. My feet and ankle were in constant pain after our first day. The pain got so bad I couldn't relax and actually enjoy myself like I usually do. Instead of looking forward to riding the rides for the entertainment value, I was looking forward to sitting so I could rest my feet and ankle. In my opinion the decision to close both modes of transportation at once was a poor decision made by Disney. I believe positive consideration for Disney would be to offer something to disabled people to compensate them for the extra walking required. Please see the picture regarding transportation.My other complaint is that I got injured an the Peter Pan's Flight ride. We had just boarded the ride, and I was getting settled on the seat when the ride operator jerked the ride to a sudden stop. We experienced whiplash just like a low impact rear ending, and it hurt my lower back. I literally not only felt my back pop/crack but also heard it.Since then I've been in constant pain having to take pain pills just to finish the trip. I made a doctor appointment and plan to get x-rays.\",\n",

Couldn't get a glimpse of the night show as people - surprise, surprise - sit on the roads to secure the best spots 3 hours before (!!!) the show, as the Disney staff starts roping off sections, which ruins everything. Can't stand and look as the staff rudely ushers you around. What the hell? Double thumbs down.I recommend to go to Disney world Paris, where you actually get to enjoy your visit.\",\n",

It has a single rider line, which involves two elevator rides, I kid you not. I almost got lost in there. I saw Tangled and Beauty and the Beast, which I both liked. And I saw a nice song and dance show at Fantasyland Theatre. And the Nemo submarine ride was good.If you have a Magic Morning entry you might want to use it for Peter Pan ride as that queue builds up fast.

Making sure to get fastpasses for the busy rides and leaving some ride for the last hour or two when the crowd dies down. We were able to do 8 rides in the last hour after fireworks and parades. When you go to theme parks be prepared for long lines and heavy crowds and start early and leave late. Take time to rest, stay hydrated and eat right. Yes water is expensive but just stop at any quick service and get a free cup of ice water. Avoid taking too much into the parks as security checks can be lengthy. Just the essentials.

The food was expensive as imagined for a theme park however the food was tasty. The park itself was exceptionally clean and today, not even a leaf was out of place. Highly recommended if you can go there. Note: selfie sticks and bags on wheels are banned, pack water food, hats and wear good walking shoes and most of all take a camera.

       " \"Both my Wife and I visited Disneyland on the first day of our trip around the Western USA. I was fortunate to visit Disneyworld in Florida back in 95 and so wanted to visit where it all began 60 years ago.Disneyland has to be seen to be believed! It is located in Anaheim and is easily accessible by car or if you are staying local by ART Transit Bus (Cheap with friendly drivers). On arriving you are whisked through security lines then a queue for the entrance. Learning throughout the day the queues are well managed and you do get through them pretty quickly! We spent most of the day collecting signatures from most of the characters and basically taking the place in. All the people in character were very friendly and very patient. Can't fault at all. We did stop for a drink and a quick bite to eat which bear in mind would not be cheap if you are in a family group. The park on the day was absolutely rammed with people, but to be fair it was kept very clean even though unfortunately some people do like drop their rubbish on the floor!!To sum it up you will need two days if you want to do the rides and collect signatures from characters. This is without going next door to the Disneyland Adventure Park next door. The day we visited there were a lot of attractions closed to make way for a new Star Wars feature in the park. For the price of $99 for a day ticket, these closed rides made the price very steep in our point of view. If you traveling with families, book the longer passes as it would work out better value. I can't see us returning, but glad we had a look.\",\n",

Most bad reviews are from clueless people who don't understand what a trip to Disney entails. There are slower times that can be found by searching the Internet for crowd charts. At some slower times I find it almost too slow, so for those who hate crowds it should be fine as long as you plan around the crowds. Can't wait for Star Wars land!\",\n",

       " 'On April 25th-28th 2016, my wife and I spent three days visiting the Disney Parks at Anaheim California. This was our first visit to Disneyland, we have visited the Orlando Disney Parks in three occasions.Most of our time was spent at Disneyland. We selected the time of our visit (after Easter and before Summer) on the assumption that it would be less crowded. Well, we could not have been more wrong. The crowds were enormous, and the lines and waiting times were very long, usually around 30-45 minutes. In many cases it was nearly impossible to move around the parks without bumping into people or nearly hitting some baby stroller.We used the fast passes whenever possible, but for some attractions, we had to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more. Adding to our frustrations was that in several instances, after standing in line for 30 minutes or so, the attraction or ride suffered some sort of mechanical problem. This was exactly what happened to us on the Peter Pan ride. When we almost reached the end of the line, there was some sort of mechanical problem, and no one could tell us whether the ride could go back in operation. Because, of this, and because there was no easy exit from the line, we had to jump over barriers and ropes. This was difficult considering our ages.That sort of annoyance also happened at the Winnie the Pooh ride. A similar, and even more frustrating situation happened to us with the \"Rollicking Roadsters\" at the California Adventures Park. It took us three attempts to finally get on this ride which broke down twice.The Anaheim parks seem to be smaller than the Orlando ones, this perhaps adds to the crowded conditions we encountered. Also, Disneyland does not offer Meal Plans or on- line fast passes. I must also add that in all our visits to Orlando Parks we never encountered so many rides and attractions out of service or breaking down.Our recommendation is that if you want to enjoy the \"Disney Magic\", you should go to Orlando and during off season times. The parks are larger, they seem to be less crowded, and there are better services, more attractions, more conveniences, and lodgings options..We did little in terms of shopping at the parks or at Downtown Disney, but we were shocked by the high prices of food, drinks, souvenirs, etc. Perhaps there was a time when Disneyland was the \"Happiest Place on Earth\", but that seems to be long in the past.',\n",

       " \"You really can't beat the original, especially in the off season. The park, as always, is fun. The diamond jubilee is just an extra treat.\",\n",
       " \"I don't know how they do it but it truly is a magical place. We had a 5 day park hopper but unfortunately our son was sick for the final day. Disney refunded our last day which was very much appreciated. We met so many characters and using the fast passes makes everything a little easier. I didn't get to try a Dole Whip so I guess I'll have to start planning another trip!\",\n",
       " \"Have been to Disneyland many times over the past half century and always was impressed with the management of the Park...until this time. Lines were impossible, litter on the ground, many closed attractions, mean staff pushing people aside during the night time parades, grout/coping missing around tiles, ran out of silverware at the French Market restaurant during lunch and no one clearing the tables when everyone was looking for a clear table to sit down, faucets not working in bathrooms at Disney Grand Hotel in the main lobby, nowhere to sit in the Lobby at the Disney Grand Hotel, no entertainment while standing in lines in the Park that lasted hours, etc., I know, operating Disneyland (when packed) with the highest levels of service is a management feat, but when I've visited the Park before, management always came through, performed brilliantly. But the attention to detail that always seemed to be the signature of Disneyland was just off this time. Just like in their recently released movie, Jungle Book, in which the boy, supposedly raised in the jungle, walks barefoot in the opening scenes like a city kid who has never walked barefoot much of anywhere, repelling slightly from pebbles and other impediments in his path. We went over to the California Adventure side to escape the crowds but same problems with lines on popular rides like the one at Radiator Springs that lasted more than two hours with possibly some of the worst background music to which I have ever been subjected. Nothing to look at amuse one self with while in line except some cactus and some bottles in the walls which, thankfully, people on the other side of the wall flashed their iphones behind to give the impression of mystery lights. When I was a kid, I remember taking the boat trip through the jungle in the main Park, and the lines were long, but the kids operating the ride seemed to have been junior comedians in training and kept cracking corny jokes which made the time in line seem to pass more quickly. But this time, in the long line rides, like the Toy Story ride, there was nothing to distract, just a mechanical Mr. Potato Head who occasionally said something. There was a kid cutting in line, apparently wanting to ride again without waiting, he told me, he had lost his babysitter, and his parents had told him to look for her in the line. He said this as he darted ahead, probably cutting the time waiting in this 90+ minute line, down to about five or ten minutes. (I expect to see him embroiled in the next Enron scandal in about ten years--a very slick operator for a 12 year old.)As crowded as the Park was, I couldn't help thinking that possibly the ticket pricing was off, or that Disneyland had sold too many annual passes and wasn't predicting well how many of the annual passholders would visit the park on any given day. Overall, it was just too crowded.\",\n",
       " \"...because it really is entirely magical. I don't care if it's expensive to get to, visit, stay nearby or eat there, or if the crowds are big & lines are long - it is still absolutely amazing!!! I first visited here 19 years ago & dreamed that one day I'd get to bring my future kids here - & it was every bit as amazing as I'd hoped. The whole family (mum, dad, 11 & 6 year old kids) enjoyed this place SO much :) My biggest 4 tips to visiting the parks would be: 1) stay at one of the Disneyland Hotels if you can - they really make the holiday perfect, are literally on the doorstep of the parks (so no stress with transport/parking etc), AND give you the early hour entry to boot. Awesome. 2) don't visit on a weekend or public/school holidays if you can help it. We were there mon-sat & it was busy enough on the weekdays, saturday was insane! 3) book in a character breakfast or dinner for your first day at the park. A bit expensive, but there is great food & you get a whole bunch of different Disney characters (different at each of the four restaurants, so read up on them to find your favourites!) who will walk around your tables, play with your kids, sign autograph books & take as many photos as you want. This will save you queuing in the park for up to an hour PER character (!!!!) - this is annoying & takes up valuable visiting time! 4) figure out & use the fast passes. I know everyone harps on about it on here, but they really are awesome once you figure out how to use them. We found that we all were much happier/patient if queuing only every second ride, & using fast passes in between where possible.Anyway, I hope everyone gets the chance to visit once in their lifetimes! We are already saving up to go back again in a few years once the new Star Wars area is open fully ;)\",\n",
       " \"Took my 7 year old son here for his birthday. We did a two day pass on a Sunday and Monday. The Sunday was insanely crowded because of something called Dapper Day. We only did a few rides. We grabbed a Splash Mountain fastpass and then hit Pirates of the Caribbean nearby (this line moved pretty fast). The ride was as fun as I remember it being. Not a lot of thrills (a few little dips) but fun. Then we hit Thunder Mountain. My son decided this was his favorite ride....until we hit Splash Mountain. He made Dad sit in the front and Dad is a bigger guy. We ended up getting completely soaked which I believe was because of the extra weight in the front. My son made me ride this ride with him 7 more times (the following day) and we sat in the front repeatedly and never got that wet. I really think the weight was the issue. I'm 135 and my hubby is probably a good 250 lbs. Anyway, we went from there to Indiana Jones and the ride wait was like 2+ hours long. We were going to possibly skip but then some people were kind enough to give us their fast passes because they changed their mind about going. We wish we would have too. My son kept his eyes shut and face towards the ground the entire ride. It was loud and bumpy. It literally just jostles you around and screams at you for three minutes. My son made me promise to never do that again. Haha. After that we decided to head out to Downtown Disney for dinner and get away from the crowds. The next day we started earlier and headed straight to Tomorrowland. I really wanted to have my son experience Star Wars and Space Mountain. I thought we'd grab fast passes and then head elsewhere. Despite it being a Monday and being early, Tommorowland was still packed. The Fast Pass was about 2 hours out which would have meant no other fast passes later. I decided we would grab a Space Mountain fast pass before dinner later in the evening so that we could burn off that time when we wouldn't be riding other rides anyway. We instead headed right back over to Splash Mountain. This is where my son decided he wanted to stay ALL DAY. We would grab a fast pass for Splash Mountain (only about a 30 minute wait), head over to Thunder Mountain in between(which didn't need a fast pass at all. The wait was like 10-15 minutes tops). We literally walked back and forth between these rides 7 times. He was happy with this. No long lines, the rides he had decided he liked and we didn't have too far a walk in between. I felt bad because I felt like he wasn't getting the full Disney experience but he didn't want to be where the crowds were so crazy. He was happy so I was happy. It's just SUPER expensive for tickets anymore so I had hoped he would make the most of it but to him, he did. It was fun but I don't know that we will be back anytime soon. Thank God for Fast Passes at least!\",\n",

       " \"Our family loves all things Disney. We have visited Anaheim a few times and as much as I hate to say it, it's not what it used to be. I still love the park, the detail, the rides, BUT I think they have probably done too good a job of selling the California resident passes because on a so called quiet week, the place was very very busy. The first time we visited, years ago, we got ourselves a map and systematically ticked off every ride and every show. In two days we had done the lot. Now, after 2 days, we'd not even achieved half of that. The magical hour is nothing like what it was. We spent half of it queuing to get in. I can't believe on their 60th anniversary, they are issuing tickets and taking security photos at the turnstile! Unbelievable. You used to do all the ticketing aspect at the ticket booth and the turnstile was a quick entrance into the park. There were rides closed for maintenance, the monorail, the Disney Train, Matterhorn and Steamboat which we were forewarned about on the app, but then several rides kept closing due to power issues - those being Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted House, Space Mountain. This meant a lot of people looking for something else to do, putting pressure on the other rides. That said, would we come back? Probably. We would give it a second chance in the hope that things have improved. Please just be prepared for a lot of long queues. Make the most of the fast passes (which ran out just after lunch). Enjoy the sights and sounds and smells that only Disney has and don't get your hopes up about how much you will achieve in a day.\",\n",

The park was overly crowded, rides kept breaking down as we were about to get on them, and the firework show that we waited around for all night was canceled due to weather. This disappointment my wife and I very much, we have been to Disneyland several times and had never been disappointed when leaving so we sent an email to Disneyland customer service that night. We didn't hear back from them right away but when we did we offered a very generous compensation because our experience that last night. Disneyland isn't perfect but if you don't have the magical experience they offer they will make it up to you some way.

Understand that a big part of Disneyland is soaking up the atmosphere and just appreciating the fact that you're there. Use FastPass wisely to cut some of the waiting time.It's really more fun without the kids!

       " 'As a \"WDW person\", I was really nervous going into Disneyland for the first time. I was afraid I was going to hate it because it was smaller with less to do, and much less vast than its Florida cousin. Or worse - I was afraid I was going to love it so much that I\\'d come back to Walt Disney World and hate everything. But neither of those things happened. What did happen - I gained a new appreciation for the parks in Florida that I\\'ve grown used to. I noticed how things were done differently in California. I got to see a completely new perspective on rides and characters that I thought I knew like the back of my hand. I didn\\'t come out of Disneyland underwhelmed or hating Disney World. I came out loving both of them for very different reasons. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to compare it to Walt Disney World because honestly, they\\'re very different places and both deserve to be appreciated in their own right. But I absolutely fell in love with Disneyland. It was so interesting to see the differences and feel the rich history of the park. It was very surreal to think that some of these attractions and places have remained mostly unchanged for the past 60 years - it\\'s just unreal. I was lucky to attend during the Diamond Celebration and I feel it was a great way to experience the park for the first time. It was amazing to see a park that so many people were so proud of. It\\'s just a different atmosphere than anything else I\\'ve experienced. Yes, it\\'s small, and can be crowded, and some rides were down when we visited - but for me it was all about the experience. As a person who likes to go go go on vacations, I was afraid we weren\\'t going to be able to do everything. But this vacation I was actually able to slow down and just take everything in, and it was amazing. There\\'s nothing quite like the experience of walking into a Disney park for the first time. It\\'s pure magic. And on my first trip to Disneyland (at the ripe old age of 23) I cried, I took it all in, and I felt the magic again.And I cant wait to go back <3',\n",

We visited on a week day and didn't have to wait more than 60 minutes for any ride, much less for 80%! We used the app to get around and plan our day and I have to say that made it a much more enjoyable experience. The only disappointment we had was that we visited in early September and that is considered 'off season' so the firework displays are only at weekends which means we didn't get to see them during our trip.\",\n",
       " 'We have never had a bad experience at Disneyland. Trip never seems to be long enough and too much time between trips.',\n",
       " 'As I expected, Disneyland was amazing! The Fastpass system is great and allowed us to skip long queues and spend more time exploring the shops, watching performances, meeting characters and trying all other rides. With the Fastpass system, the maximum amount of time I had to wait to hop on a ride was ~20 mins. The only downside was that due to weather conditions, they had to stop the fireworks display halfway through.',\n",
       " \"We regularly go to Disney World in Orlando, but this was our first trip to California. We're Disney fanatics and we had a fantastic time. Rides were awesome and updated, the food was fantastic and I didn't notice a huge price difference either. I would recommend more shaded areas, but that's not a deal breaker to me! Try the fruity pebbles donuts if you get a chance! We're already craving another trip!\",\n",
       " 'We were able to meet lots of characters for photos, the fireworks were amazing, Disney staff very attentive, great shopping, good rides queues not as long as Orlando park.',\n",
       " 'On our last day, several rides were broken on top of the 2 rides closed for refurbishment. Extremely frustrating.',\n",
       " 'We are from the Midwest so a trip to Disneyland was a much anticipated event. We have been to Disney World many times but this was our first visit as a family to Disneyland. We went to the park at opening which allowed us to be one of the first riders on several of the rides. My husband had the foresight to buy the max pass. Which made our wait times much less for the popular rides. We had pre-planned our lunch at Cafe Orleans. Our lunch was superb! The Monte Cristo was the best I had ever eaten. The service was very good and even though we were sitting outside we felt it was shaded and restful. We made sure to stop by the Tiki Room and grabbed a Dole Whip Float to enjoy during the show. Both are always a family favorite. The weather was perfect unlike the heat of Orlando, which made our day very comfortable. The highlight of our day was definately seeing our son meet and have his picture taken with Chewbacca at the Star Port in Tomorrowland. We all decided that Disneyland was a definite do-again on our bucket list of family fun!',\n",
       " 'Shoulder to shoulder, hot with minimal shade, lines too long to actually go on anything.After several dismissive interactions with staff the whole horrible weekend culminated in me sitting on a bench and crying, while passersby (and \"cast members\") pretended not to see me.I\\'ve never felt less valued as a customer. I wish we\\'d saved the money. I would never go back.',\n",
       " \"I feel there are more shops than rides in the park and you can tell that it's the first one I have been to Florida and found that the Disney park there was far superior to this it was ok a couple of the rides went fast I feel that this particular one has more geared up for young children then for couples also when we went some of the new attractions were not open despite having a schedule to say that they would be\",\n",

Prices have increased but the rides haven't . In fact it actually seems like the roller coasters are often down when we go. Last time, Big Thunder was down the entire day. And Space Mtn had numerous times throughout the day been down. If they are going to continually increase admission prices, they ought to be giving more for the money. Value is diminishing. It is still the cleanest amusement park we've been to.\n",

      "Document: For a family of four spending $800 for ONE DAY at a park, there should be a lot of rides to be experienced. Sadly, five rides in one day does not cut it. It was extremely disappointing. The Jungle Cruise, usually a 10-minute wait, was an hour. I'm a Southern California resident so I know this park like the back of my hand. My husband and I experienced a first while waiting in line for this ride. Seriously, in the 100-plus times I've been on this ride, I've never gone UPSTAIRS and INTO another building while waiting in line. This is absurd. Splash Mountain was closed. Star Tours and Indiana Jones both had 90+ minute waits. REALLY? IT GETS WORSE. THERE WAS A LINE for Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (the exhibit that NEVER has a line). Needless to say, it was almost a total waste of $800. We did end up just going down Main Street and checking out every store because we just wanted to get away from the mass of humanity. I hate to complain but there are things that have changed at Disneyland.My biggest complaint, and one that Disney can't do anything about, is that modern technology has made walking through the park a painful experience. I was constantly getting run into or my toes stepped on because people (young and old alike) were too busy looking down at their SmartPhones instead of looking at where they were going. When it's VERY CROWDED, this is a HUGE problem. I ended up with a torn toenail (I was wearing closed-toe shoes) because some idiot walked right into me and scoffed the top of my foot with his hiking boot.ANOTHER PROBLEM: While we waited 30 minutes to buy our tickets, my husband's credit card was declined. Turns out the credit card company thought there was some suspicious activity on the card and temporarily suspended it. While my husband was on the phone talking with the credit card company, the window where we were trying to buy tickets closed. I asked the security guard if we had to go to another line and wait again. Yep, we did. The credit card company re-activated my husband's credit card and we had to wait another 30 minutes in another line. The whole time my husband was fuming at a seemingly uncaring security guard. Come on, Disney. This is bad customer service. So is allowing these double-wide strollers into the park, ESPECIALLY when there is a parade going on. You can't move around well and you get rammed by these strollers because the parents pushing them don't have any perspective.Food-wise, it was better than usual. We ate at the Bengal BBQ (across from Jungle Cruise) and the spicy kebabs were surprisingly good. Yes, one kebab won't fill you up, but we ordered a bunch of different stuff and were very happy with the quality. It is not typical Disney fare. Finally. props to the cast members at Haunted House and Pirates of the Caribbean. The lines were long but the line was constantly moving, which is a good thing. The wait was about 45 minutes for each ride. Food-wise, I HIGHLY recommend the kebabs at Bengal Barbecue. Also, the burgers at Taste Pilot (California Adventure) are good. If you have the luxury of making reservations and want a real Disney experience, eat a Monte Cristo (at $25, it's the cheapest entree on the menu) at the Blue Bayou. Note: for a family of four, you won't get out of here for less than a $100. If you can afford to splurge, eat at Napa Rose at California Adventure. It's outstanding. Local resident tip: If you happen to visit this park in December, don't miss the ride It's a Small World. They change all of the doll's costumes to reflect a winter theme. ALSO... check out the fire station on Main Street with your little ones. You can decorate holiday cookies with the firemen and keep the cookies!\n"
